### Prompt 1

On the recovery phrase screen during onboarding the two screens (generated phrase and custom phrase) have different layout. I would like it to be unified. see difference between image 1 and image 2. Also the error in image 3 has too much space around it. Push it closer to the text area and move the buttons to align with the previous screen.

### Prompt 2
