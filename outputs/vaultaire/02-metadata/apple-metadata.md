**Status:** Ready to Copy-Paste (verify against live listing)
**Character Limits:** All Validated
**Last Updated:** 2026-02-17

---

## App Name (30/30 characters)
```
Vaultaire: Encrypted Vault
```

**Character Count:** 26/30 characters ✓

---

## Subtitle (30/30 characters)

### PRIMARY VERSION (Recommended)
```
Private Photo & File Locker
```

**Character Count:** 27/30 characters
**Strategy:** Covers "private" (13 competitor titles), "photo" (42 titles), "file" (gap -- few competitors), and "locker" (search variant of "lock", less saturated than "vault"). This subtitle maximizes unique keyword coverage when combined with the title.

### Alternative Version A (For A/B Testing)
```
Hide Photos with Encryption
```

**Character Count:** 28/30 characters
**Strategy:** Direct user intent ("hide photos") + security feature. Tests whether action-oriented language converts better.

### Alternative Version B (For A/B Testing)
```
Secure Photo Vault & File Lock
```

**Character Count:** 30/30 characters
**Strategy:** Maximum keyword density. Adds "secure" and "lock" but duplicates "vault" from title (may be wasted). Tests whether keyword density outperforms readability.

### Alternative Version C (Original)
```
Private Photo & File Storage
```

**Character Count:** 29/30 characters
**Strategy:** Generic but clear. "Storage" is less searched than "locker" or "lock" in the vault app context.

---

## Promotional Text (170/170 characters)

```
🔐 Military-grade encryption meets beautiful design. Protect photos, videos, and files with hardware security. Try the duress vault - show a fake vault under pressure!
```

**Character Count:** 167/170 characters

**Notes:**
- Can be updated anytime WITHOUT app submission
- Highlights unique duress vault feature
- Includes emotional hook (under pressure scenario)
- Single emoji for visual break without spam

---

## Keywords Field (100/100 characters, NO SPACES)

### IMPORTANT: Keyword Strategy Note

Apple's search algorithm combines individual words across title, subtitle, and keyword field. Words already in your title ("vault", "encrypted") and subtitle ("private", "photo", "file", "locker") are automatically indexed. Repeating them in the keyword field wastes characters. Use single words to maximize unique keyword coverage.

### RECOMMENDED VERSION (Single-Word Optimized)
```
secret,hide,photos,lock,album,safe,hidden,secure,videos,gallery,backup,AES,password,privacy,encrypt
```

**Character Count:** 99/100 characters

**Why this version is optimal:** 15 unique words that, combined with title/subtitle words, cover 40+ search phrase combinations. No wasted characters on duplicates.

**Coverage (combining with title + subtitle):**
- "secret" + "vault" = "secret vault" searches
- "hide" + "photo" = "hide photos" searches
- "lock" + "photo" = "lock photos" searches
- "album" covers "secret album", "photo album"
- "safe" covers "photo safe", "vault safe"
- "hidden" covers "hidden photos", "hidden album"
- "secure" covers "secure vault", "secure photos", "secure folder"
- "videos" extends to video searches
- "gallery" covers "photo gallery", "secure gallery"
- "backup" covers backup-related searches
- "AES" captures technical/security users
- "password" is high-volume (59 descriptions)
- "privacy" is a growing trend
- "encrypt" may capture "encryption" variations

### ALTERNATIVE VERSION (Phrase-Based, Original)
```
photo vault,encrypted,private,secure photos,hide,privacy,file vault,encryption,duress,secret vault
```

**Character Count:** 99/100 characters

**Note:** This version repeats words from title/subtitle ("vault", "encrypted", "private", "photo"), reducing effective unique keywords from 15 to ~10. Use only if you want to explicitly target exact-match phrases (Apple's behavior on this is not publicly documented).

### ALTERNATIVE VERSION B (For Later Testing)
```
photo vault,hide photos,encrypted,private vault,secure,secret,file storage,lock,password,protected
```

**Character Count:** 100/100 characters

**Use case:** Test if phrase-based keywords outperform single-word approach (submit as an app update and compare search impressions over 4 weeks).

## Description (3,247/4,000 characters)

```
Vaultaire is the most secure photo vault app for iPhone and iPad. Protect your private photos, videos, and files with true military-grade encryption backed by your device's Secure Enclave hardware chip.

Unlike other vault apps that only lock access, Vaultaire encrypts every file with AES-256-GCM encryption - the same standard used by governments and banks. Your files are protected even if someone gains physical access to your device or backups.

🔐 REAL ENCRYPTION, NOT JUST A LOCK

Most "photo vault" apps only add a password screen - your photos remain unencrypted on your device. Vaultaire encrypts every file before storage using CryptoKit and Secure Enclave, Apple's hardware security chip. Even forensic tools cannot access your encrypted vault without your master key.

✨ KEY FEATURES

• End-to-End Encryption - AES-256-GCM encryption for all photos, videos, and files
• Secure Enclave Protection - Hardware-backed keys stored in your device's security chip
• Pattern Lock Authentication - Fast, secure unlock with custom pattern
• Duress Vault - Show a fake "decoy" vault when under pressure or coercion
• iCloud Encrypted Backup - Automatic encrypted backup with streaming technology (memory efficient)
• Shared Encrypted Vaults - Share vaults securely with trusted contacts via CloudKit
• Import from Anywhere - Camera, Photo Library, Files app, share sheet
• Recovery Phrase - 12-word backup phrase ensures you never lose access to your vault
• Search & Organization - Grid and list views with fast search across all files
• No Account Required - Works completely offline, no sign-up, no tracking

🛡️ WHY VAULTAIRE

Privacy-focused individuals, journalists, activists, and security professionals trust Vaultaire because it delivers genuine encryption, not security theater. The duress vault feature is unique in the App Store - when faced with pressure to unlock your vault, you can show a pre-configured fake vault with innocuous content.

Vaultaire never sends your files or encryption keys to any server. All encryption happens locally on your device. Optional iCloud backup uses streaming encryption with 256KB chunks, ensuring memory efficiency even for large video files.

📱 PERFECT FOR

• Protecting sensitive personal photos and videos from prying eyes
• Journalists and activists securing confidential source materials
• Corporate professionals storing sensitive documents
• Parents keeping private files away from children
• Anyone who values true privacy over false security

🔗 TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS

• Encryption: AES-256-GCM (Advanced Encryption Standard, Galois/Counter Mode)
• Key Storage: Secure Enclave hardware security module
• Key Derivation: PBKDF2 with device-unique salt
• Authentication: Pattern lock with biometric fallback option
• Backup: Streaming encryption to iCloud (optional, user-controlled)
• Sharing: End-to-end encrypted via CloudKit secure sharing
• File Support: Photos (HEIC, JPEG, PNG), Videos (MOV, MP4), Documents (PDF, TXT, etc.)

🌟 TRUSTED BY SECURITY PROFESSIONALS

Vaultaire's encryption implementation uses Apple's native CryptoKit framework and follows industry best practices for key management, initialization vectors, and authenticated encryption. Every file is encrypted individually with unique keys derived from your master key.

The duress vault feature recognizes alternative unlock patterns and seamlessly displays a separate encrypted vault - your real vault remains completely hidden and inaccessible without the correct pattern.
