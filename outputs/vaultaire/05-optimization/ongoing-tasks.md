## Automation Opportunities

### Can Be Automated
- Download/impression tracking (App Store Connect API or third-party tools)
- Crash monitoring alerts (Sentry already configured)
- Competitor update notifications (third-party ASO tools)
- Review notifications (App Store Connect app push notifications)

### Should Stay Manual
- Review responses (personal touch and contextual accuracy matter)
- Keyword strategy decisions (requires market understanding)
- Metadata writing (creative + strategic)
- Screenshot design (visual and messaging decisions)
- Competitor analysis (strategic interpretation, not just data collection)

---

## Recommended Tools (Optional)

**Free:**
- App Store Connect (Apple's built-in analytics)
- App Store Connect iOS app (mobile monitoring)
- Sentry (already integrated for crash monitoring)
- Spreadsheet for keyword tracking

**Paid (when budget allows):**
- AppTweak or Sensor Tower -- keyword tracking, competitor monitoring, ASO scoring
- Appbot or AppFollow -- review management and sentiment analysis
- RevenueCat dashboard -- subscription analytics (if already using RevenueCat)

---

**Core principle:** ASO is not "set it and forget it." The apps that rank well in the App Store are the ones that iterate on metadata monthly, respond to reviews promptly, and continuously test their store listing. Fifteen minutes a day of consistent monitoring compounds into significant advantages over competitors who only optimize at launch.
