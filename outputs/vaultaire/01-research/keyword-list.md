## Recommended Title and Subtitle

**Title (30 chars):** `Vaultaire: Encrypted Vault` (26 chars)
- Includes brand name + "Encrypted" (unique differentiator) + "Vault" (highest-frequency keyword)
- "Encrypted" appears in 0/8 top competitor titles -- strong differentiation signal

**Subtitle (30 chars):** `Private Photo & File Locker` (27 chars) -- RECOMMENDED
- Targets "private" (13 title uses), "photo" (42 title uses), "locker" (3 title uses)
- "File" expands scope beyond just photos -- a gap in competitors
- "Locker" is a less saturated variant of "lock" and adds a unique indexed word
- Alternative A: `Hide Photos with Encryption` (28 chars) -- action-oriented, for A/B test
- Alternative B: `Secure Photo Vault & File Lock` (30 chars) -- max density but duplicates "vault"
- Alternative C: `Private Photo & File Storage` (29 chars) -- generic, "storage" less searched

## Apple Keyword Field (100 chars)

The keyword field is comma-separated, no spaces after commas, no duplicates with title/subtitle. Apple does NOT index the description, so every important keyword must be here or in title/subtitle.

**Words already covered by Title + Subtitle:**
- Title "Vaultaire: Encrypted Vault": `encrypted`, `vault`
- Subtitle "Private Photo & File Locker": `private`, `photo`, `file`, `locker`

**Optimized Keyword Field (100 chars):**

```
secret,hide,photos,lock,album,safe,hidden,secure,videos,gallery,backup,AES,password,privacy,encrypt
```

Character count: 99 characters

**Breakdown:**
- `secret` (24 titles) -- high volume
- `hide` (14 titles) -- high intent
- `photos` (13 titles) -- plural variant
- `lock` (21 titles) -- high volume
- `album` (13 titles) -- familiar concept
- `safe` (7 titles) -- trust keyword
- `hidden` (7 titles) -- search variant
- `secure` (7 titles) -- security signal
- `videos` (3 titles) -- extends to video content
- `gallery` (4 titles) -- photo gallery searches
- `backup` (29 descriptions) -- key feature
- `AES` (4 descriptions) -- technical differentiator
- `password` (59 descriptions) -- high volume
- `privacy` -- growing search trend
- `encrypt` -- root form captures "encryption" variations

**Alternative Keyword Field (if targeting more long-tail):**

```
secret,hide,photos,lock,album,safe,hidden,secure,video,biometric,backup,AES,end-to-end,pic,folder
```

Character count: 97 characters

## Keyword Density Targets for Description

Apple does not index descriptions for search, but they influence conversion (users read them). Google Play indexes descriptions, but Vaultaire is iOS-only for now.

**Description Keyword Strategy (for conversion, not search):**
- Mention "encrypted" or "encryption" 3-5 times in description
- Mention "AES-256" and "Secure Enclave" at least once each (credibility)
- Use "private," "secure," and "protect" throughout
- Include "photo vault," "file vault," and "encrypted vault" as natural phrases
- Mention "iCloud backup," "Face ID," "pattern lock" as feature keywords
- Reference "duress vault" or "decoy vault" for differentiation
- Use "zero-knowledge" and "end-to-end" for technical credibility

## Keyword Priority Matrix

```
                    HIGH SEARCH VOLUME
                          |
     "photo vault"        |        "private photos"
     "secret photos"      |        "hide photos"
     "photo locker"       |        "lock photos"
                          |
  HIGH COMPETITION -------+------- LOW COMPETITION
                          |
     "secure folder"      |     ** "encrypted vault" **
     "safe photos"        |     ** "AES photo vault" **
     "hidden album"       |     ** "end-to-end photos" **
                          |     ** "secure enclave vault" **
                          |
                    LOW SEARCH VOLUME
```

**Strategy:** Compete on high-volume terms (photo vault, secret, private) through title/subtitle/keywords, but DIFFERENTIATE through low-competition encryption terms that no competitor owns. The bottom-right quadrant is Vaultaire's blue ocean.

## Search Volume Estimation Methodology

Search volume estimates are derived from:
1. **iTunes API result count:** More results = more competition = likely higher volume
2. **Competitor rating counts:** Higher aggregate ratings in a search = more user activity for that term
3. **Cross-search appearance:** Apps appearing in 15+ searches are targeting high-volume terms
4. **Industry benchmarks:** Photo vault category is established with market leaders having 300K-1M+ ratings

**Confidence level:** Medium. Precise search volumes require Apple Search Ads or third-party tools (Sensor Tower, AppTweak). The relative rankings and competition assessments are high-confidence based on real API data.
