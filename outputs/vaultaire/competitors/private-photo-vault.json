    "Ads in free version are intrusive and frequent",

  "positioning": "Unlike Private Photo Vault's PIN-based hiding with optional cloud encryption, Vaultaire encrypts every file at rest with AES-256-GCM and Secure Enclave key protection from the moment of import, with no premium tier required for real security."
