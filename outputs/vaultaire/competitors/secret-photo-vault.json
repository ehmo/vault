    "Very outdated UI and screenshots from 2020 era",
    "No cloud backup means data loss risk",
    "Small developer with infrequent updates",
    "No English seller name raises trust concerns",

  "positioning": "Unlike this legacy 2011 app with local-only storage and basic folder passwords, Vaultaire is built on modern SwiftUI with AES-256-GCM encryption, Secure Enclave integration, and encrypted cloud backup."
