## User Prompts

### Prompt 1

I want to clean up and unify all design across the app.

First, the mode of the app, system, dark, light doesn't immediately change the design of the screen. Instead it changes the back screen but not the settings screen. Second I think this should be a menu Settings -> App settings -> Appearance -> System, Dark, Light. And it should change the whole screen instantly.

Also don't push to testflight just yet. I got lots of things I want to fix

Go through all screens and unify the colors. I want everything to use the structure of the set custom recovery phrase.

### Prompt 6

When using the share extension adding lots of files, the files don't get really synced. If you watch the video /Users/nan/Downloads/ScreenRecording_02-14-2026\ 21-33-19_1.MP4 you can see that it never gets past 40% and when I open the vault nothing shows in it. In fact on the first attempt the app crashesh and then data never shows up there
