I want to expand on the onboarding flow in the ios app and add some more explanations. Help me think through how to explain the top concepts:
- pattern based encryption
- plausible deniability
- duress vault
- encrypted and identity-less sharing
- encrypted backup
- hardware security

I would like to add these right after the first screen. I want you to create HTML version of these first so we can iterate on them, on the wording and design.

Remember that the phone screens are small and people don't like lots of text. So we should absolutely focus on visual impact and brevity and clarity over lots of words and complex explanations.

I really like these. Let's implement them into the app to match the style as closely of the app. We will replace all of the graphics but I want to first see how it looks in the app itself. I want you to place them after the first onboarding screen.
