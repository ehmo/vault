I want to improve the onboarding screens. 

add duress vault to the main screeen to the area with red rectangle.

Duress Vault
If forced to unlock, the duress pattern silently wipes your real vaults.

Hold of testing and deployment until I explicitly tell you

Anchor the text in red rectangle right above the slider. This applies to all texts for these screens. I want them to be at the bottom.

The text is poorly wrapped. Try to fit it the heading across this screen and then wrap the subtext around the same dimensions.

The pattern is 4x4 in the image, but we are using 5x5. Also match the colors to the current color scheme.

Again, move the text down as in the previous screen.

Replace your view abstract with an abstract closer resembling the vault (we use 3x5 gallery grid). So make an abstract that doesn't look like notifications but rather our existing screen.

For this screen, again we are using 5x5 grid so match that. Also try to make the dots more in a pattern and use also lines there.

Move the text down again. And we use the name of Duress Vault instead of Decoy Vault

Again move the text down like the other screens. Also expand the title for the whole line.

Again move the text down and expand the header to the whole line. Then fix the checkbox list so it's actually under each other.

Final screen, just move the text down.

Make sure for all screens the text is in exactly the same position between them.

Ok, I also want all screens in onboarding to have their main button in the same position.

So in the first screen it's Continue, next screen continue, etc. I want to rename the Get Started one to Continue too. For the analytics screen the no thanks should be not a button but a text like on the give us rating screeen. And the no thank you should be align on the bottom with the continue buttons from the previous screens. The only exception is the paywall screen that is longer than the 16e screen.
