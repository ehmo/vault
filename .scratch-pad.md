# Scratch Pad — Continual Learning Log

## Session Log

### Session 1 — UX Design Audit Implementation (Feb 8, 2026)
- **Query**: Implement 11-workstream UX design audit plan (WS1-WS11) across the Vaultaire iOS app
- **Approach**: Sequential workstream implementation with build verification and git commit after each
- **Errors**:
  - `.foregroundStyle(.accentColor)` fails — `ShapeStyle` has no member `accentColor`. Fix: use `Color.accentColor`
  - `bd update ○` failed — passed status indicator character instead of issue ID. Fix: use `bd list` to get actual ID
- **Corrections**: None from user — autonomous implementation
- **Key Learnings**:
  - Codable optionals (`Date?`) provide backward compat for existing vault indexes without migration
  - When adding files to pbxproj manually, use `UX` prefix IDs for UX-related additions (consistent with `LA`, `SE` prefixes)
  - `SubscriptionManager.maxFreeFilesPerVault` is a static constant (100) — reference directly, don't duplicate the value
  - Date grouping with photo viewer requires computing global index across all sorted images, not per-group index

### Session 2 — Share Upload Failure Fix (Feb 8, 2026)
- **Query**: Vault share fails with "shared vault couldn't be completed" after CloudKit upload starts
- **Approach**: Traced upload flow through ShareVaultView → BackgroundShareTransferManager → CloudKitSharingManager. Identified two root causes.
- **Root Causes**:
  - No `UIApplication.beginBackgroundTask()` — iOS suspends app when user dismisses share sheet, killing the in-flight CloudKit upload. Telemetry showed only 3 Live Activity ticks (~0.5s) before silence = classic iOS suspension.
  - No retry on transient CKErrors — a single network hiccup on any of 9 sequential chunk saves causes immediate failure.
- **Fix**: Added `beginBackgroundTask`/`endBackgroundTask` wrapping both upload and import `Task.detached` closures. Added `saveWithRetry()` with 3 retries + exponential backoff for transient CKErrors (networkFailure, serviceUnavailable, zoneBusy, requestRateLimited).
- **Key Learnings**:
  - `Task.detached` does NOT get background execution time — iOS can suspend it immediately when app backgrounds
  - `CKDatabase.save()` convenience API has no QoS/timeout config — for production use, consider `CKModifyRecordsOperation`
  - `CKError.retryAfterSeconds` provides server-suggested retry delay — always respect it before falling back to exponential backoff
  - The upload flow: BackgroundShareTransferManager orchestrates (re-encrypt files → plist encode → CloudKitSharingManager uploads chunks sequentially → saves manifest)

### Session 3 — Incremental Sync for Shared Vaults (Feb 9, 2026)
- **Query**: Implement SVDF v4 incremental sync — adding 1 file to shared vault was re-encrypting and re-uploading ALL files
- **Approach**: 4-layer optimization: (1) append-stable binary format (SVDFSerializer), (2) per-share encrypted file cache (ShareSyncCache), (3) chunk-hash diffing in CloudKit upload, (4) recipient delta import
- **Files created**: SVDFSerializer.swift, ShareSyncCache.swift
- **Files modified**: ShareSyncManager.swift (replaced full rebuild with incremental), CloudKitSharingManager.swift (added syncSharedVaultIncremental), BackgroundShareTransferManager.swift (SVDF v4 for initial upload + cache init), VaultView.swift (delta import for SVDF, legacy fallback for v1-v3), VaultStorage.swift (syncSequence on ShareRecord)
- **Errors**: None — first-attempt build success
- **Key Learnings**:
  - Duplicate simulator names cause `xcodebuild` ambiguity — use `-destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,id=<UUID>'` instead of `name=`
  - Sharing group in pbxproj uses `014000xxx` prefix IDs
  - VaultFileEntry has optional `filename`, `mimeType`, `createdAt` — always provide fallback values when building SharedFile from entries
  - Binary format with little-endian encoding requires careful cursor tracking; `Data.readUInt32(at:)` helpers avoid raw pointer arithmetic
  - CloudKit deterministic record IDs (`{shareVaultId}_chunk_{index}`) allow update-in-place without delete+create

## Error Tracker

- **ShapeStyle vs Color**: `.foregroundStyle(.accentColor)` doesn't compile — `accentColor` is on `Color`, not `ShapeStyle`. Always use `Color.accentColor` or `.tint(.accentColor)`.
- **Beads ID parsing**: `bd` commands need the actual issue ID (e.g., `VAULT-5vs`), not display characters. Always run `bd list` first if unsure.
- **SourceKit false positives**: Cross-file SourceKit diagnostics ("Cannot find X in scope") are common in this project and don't represent real build errors. Trust `xcodebuild` results over editor diagnostics.
- **@MainActor singleton calls need `await`**: `ShareSyncManager`, `BackgroundShareTransferManager`, `DeepLinkHandler` are all `@MainActor`. Calling their methods from `Task { }` or `Task.detached { }` requires `await` — Swift 6 strict concurrency treats cross-actor calls as implicitly async. This has regressed multiple times. Prevention: ALWAYS add `await` when calling any `@MainActor` singleton method from inside `Task`/`Task.detached` blocks. Check ALL three `scheduleSync` call sites when modifying import handlers.
- **Task.detached + backgrounding = suspension**: iOS will suspend `Task.detached` closures when the app backgrounds. Any long-running work (CloudKit uploads, network calls) MUST be wrapped in `beginBackgroundTask`/`endBackgroundTask`.
- **Embrace setup off main queue can crash**: `Embrace.setup(...).start()` executed inside `Task.detached` triggered `dispatch_assert_queue` in `HangCaptureService.init` during onboarding analytics opt-in. Prevention: run Embrace setup/start on `@MainActor` only.
- **No retry on CloudKit saves**: `CKDatabase.save()` has no built-in retry. Transient errors (network hiccups, rate limits) cause immediate failure. Always wrap in retry logic.
- **CKRecord INSERT vs UPDATE**: `CKRecord(recordType:recordID:)` creates a NEW record object. `save()` on it attempts INSERT, failing with `serverRecordChanged` (code 14) if record exists. To UPDATE, must FETCH the existing record first via `publicDatabase.record(for:)`, modify its fields, then save. This is critical for incremental chunk updates.
- **Initial upload → sync cache gap**: `uploadSharedVault()` creates chunks in CloudKit but doesn't initialize `ShareSyncCache`. First `syncSharedVaultIncremental()` call sees empty `previousChunkHashes` → tries INSERT on all existing chunks → CKError 14. Prevention: always fetch-or-create before save.
- **deinit + [weak self] = crash**: `[weak self]` in closures dispatched from `deinit` causes "Cannot form weak reference to instance in process of deallocation". Prevention: capture specific properties by value, not `self`.
- **SwiftUI animation leak in ZStack**: `.animation(_:value:)` on one child in a ZStack can affect siblings. Prevention: isolate animated elements in separate overlays.
- **Background task async endBackgroundTask**: `Task { @MainActor in UIApplication.shared.endBackgroundTask(id) }` inside `defer` may never execute when the app is being suspended. Prevention: use `MainActor.assumeIsolated` in the expiration handler to call `endBackgroundTask` synchronously. Store `bgTaskId` as a property with an idempotent `endBackgroundExecution()` helper.
- **Orphaned background task IDs**: Calling `beginBackgroundTask` multiple times without ending old ones leaks task IDs. Prevention: always call `endBackgroundExecution()` before `beginBackgroundTask`, and store only one `currentBgTaskId`.
- **UI only showing happy-path status**: Showing UI only for `.uploading` but not `.uploadFailed`/`.uploadComplete` means the user sees nothing when things fail. Prevention: always handle ALL non-idle enum cases in status UI.
- **Stale simulator UUID**: Simulator UUIDs get invalidated when Xcode/simulators update. `xcodebuild test -destination 'id=<UUID>'` fails with "Unable to boot deleted device". Prevention: run `xcrun simctl list devices available` to find currently booted/available simulators.
- **Duplicate simulator names break destination by name**: `xcodebuild ... -destination 'name=iPhone 17 Pro'` can fail if two simulators differ only by casing (e.g. `iPhone 17 Pro` and `iphone 17 pro`). Prevention: use destination by explicit simulator UUID (`id=<UUID>`).
- **Maestro can't always target SwiftUI TextEditor by id**: `TextEditor` can fail `id` matching in sheet contexts even when `.accessibilityIdentifier` is set. Prevention: use `tapOn: point` to focus the editor before `inputText`.
- **Maestro `addMedia` no parent paths**: `addMedia` resolves paths relative to the YAML file but does NOT support `../` parent traversal. Prevention: place test media in the same directory or use symlinks.
- **Maestro `wait`/`clearInput` don't exist**: No `wait: N` command (use `waitForAnimationToEnd: timeout: N000`), no `clearInput` (use `eraseText: charactersToErase: N`).
- **Maestro `clearState` resets UserDefaults**: `clearState: true` wipes ALL UserDefaults including `hasCompletedOnboarding`. Prevention: re-set required defaults in test mode init.
- **Maestro `clearKeychain` triggers system dialog**: Apple Account Verification dialog blocks automation. Prevention: remove `clearKeychain: true`, add dismiss taps for "Not Now".
- **Empty state hides FAB**: `vault_add_button` only visible when files exist. Prevention: use `vault_first_files` (empty state) or `-MAESTRO_SEED_FILES` to pre-populate vault.
- **@MainActor static Logger in nonisolated context**: `private static let logger` on a `@MainActor` class cannot be accessed from `nonisolated static` methods — Swift 6 error, Swift 5 warning. Prevention: use file-level `private let logger` outside the class for any class that has `nonisolated` methods.
- **Bare VaultIndex init = no master key**: `VaultIndex(files:nextOffset:totalSize:)` (v1 init) creates index without `encryptedMasterKey`. Saving this then calling `storeFile` throws `corruptedData` because `getMasterKey` finds nil. Prevention: ALWAYS use `VaultStorage.shared.loadIndex(with:)` for new vault creation — it auto-creates proper v3 index with master key + blob.
- **xcodebuild archive + Automatic signing + no devices = fail**: Automatic signing tries to create Development profiles (which need devices) even for Release/distribution archive. Prevention: use Manual signing for Release configs with `CODE_SIGN_IDENTITY[sdk=iphoneos*]` = "Apple Distribution" and `PROVISIONING_PROFILE_SPECIFIER[sdk=iphoneos*]` = profile name.
- **Sentry build phase cycle**: Sentry dSYM upload script BEFORE Embed Foundation Extensions creates dependency cycle (dSYM input → built binary → embedded extensions → Info.plist → cycle). Prevention: always place Sentry script AFTER Embed Foundation Extensions in build phases.
- **TestFlight tester invite before group has build**: `asc testflight beta-testers invite` fails with "no installable builds" until `asc builds add-groups` assigns a build to the group. Prevention: add build to group first, then invite testers.
- **macOS keychain import with empty p12 password**: `security import` with `-P ""` fails. Prevention: use `openssl pkcs12 -legacy` with a temp password, then import with that password.
- **Incomplete screen cloning**: When replicating a flow from another screen (e.g., join vault pattern from onboarding pattern), copying only the core logic but missing validation, haptics, error handling, and feedback UI creates a degraded UX. Prevention: always mirror the FULL behavior including all user feedback paths.
- **Removing "flashing" UI removes essential feedback**: User asked to remove validation feedback that "showed for a split second" on ChangePatternView. Removed the entire `validationResult` + `validationFeedback`, which also removed error display for invalid patterns. The flash was because valid patterns immediately transition — invalid patterns need the feedback to stay visible. Prevention: when UI "flashes", the fix is usually to prevent the auto-transition (or accept the flash), NOT to remove the feature. Always check: does this UI serve a purpose when the user stays on the screen?
- **Pattern grid position jumping between steps**: Different subtitle text lengths, different button counts, and presence/absence of feedback area changed Spacer distribution, moving the grid. Prevention: ALL variable-content areas in pattern screens need fixed heights — subtitle `.frame(height: 44)`, feedback `Group.frame(height: 80)`, buttons use `.hidden()` placeholders for consistent height.
- **Missing Maestro tests for UI changes**: Visual changes without corresponding Maestro test updates means regressions go undetected. Prevention: mandatory checklist in AGENTS.md — new screens need flows, new elements need accessibility IDs + assertions.
- **TestFlight internal groups can't be manually assigned builds**: `asc builds add-groups` fails with "Cannot add internal group to a build." Internal groups with `hasAccessToAllBuilds: true` automatically receive ALL builds. Prevention: skip `add-groups` for internal groups, only use it for external beta groups.
- **ASC build indexing lag after upload**: Immediately after `xcodebuild`/ASC upload succeeds, `asc builds latest --version <N>` may return "no pre-release version found" for a short period. Prevention: poll `asc builds list --sort -uploadedDate` until the build appears, then gate release completion on `processingState = VALID`.
- **BGProcessing task completion contract**: If a `BGProcessingTask` starts but `setTaskCompleted(success:)` is not called on every path (success/failure/expiration/no-op), iOS deprioritizes future launches and background continuation becomes unreliable. Prevention: centralize completion handling and call it in `finishTransfer`, `cancel`, and expiration handlers.
- **ASC delayed build visibility**: After upload, build queries may return `not-found` for a few minutes before the row appears (sometimes already `VALID`). Prevention: poll `asc builds list --sort -uploadedDate --limit 20` with retry windows instead of treating initial misses as failures.
- **Share extension main-actor crypto kills**: Running multi-file encryption/thumbnail loops on the extension main actor can trigger abrupt extension termination (watchdog/jetsam) near the end of processing with no graceful error UI. Prevention: keep UI state updates on main actor, but execute heavy per-file sync crypto/thumbnail work off-main (detached/background executor).
- **Share extension provider-retention pressure**: Holding full-batch `NSItemProvider` references in memory during long share runs increases extension memory pressure. Prevention: two-pass strategy (count first, process sequentially) without a retained provider array.
- **Dynamic Island loader drift from dual step sources**: Combining app-side `animationStep` ticks with widget-side timeline ticks (`baseStep + timelineStep`) changes loader speed versus in-app loaders. Prevention: use a single 0.1s timeline cadence in the widget renderer.
- **Inconsistent PixelAnimation presets**: `uploading()` and `downloading()` had different patterns (column sweep vs perimeter walk) and dimmer brightness (2 vs 3) than `loading()` / Dynamic Island. `syncing()` also had dimmer brightness. Prevention: removed `uploading()`/`downloading()`, made `syncing()` delegate to `loading()`. ONLY use `PixelAnimation.loading(size:)` — never create alternate patterns.
- **RECURRING: Keyboard pushes sheet background up**: Sheets presented over PatternLockView (RecoveryPhraseInputView, JoinVaultView) lack `.ignoresSafeArea(.keyboard)`, causing SwiftUI's automatic keyboard avoidance to push the sheet content up when the text field is focused. The parent PatternLockView has it, but sheets are independent view hierarchies. This has regressed 3+ times. Prevention: ANY view presented as a `.sheet` that contains a `TextEditor` or `TextField` MUST have `.ignoresSafeArea(.keyboard)` on its root container. Checklist: RecoveryPhraseInputView, JoinVaultView, SharedVaultInviteView, CustomRecoveryPhraseInputView — all need it.
- **`.gesture()` blocks TabView paging**: Using `.gesture(dragGesture)` on a TabView prevents its internal page swipe from working. The gesture system treats it as a primary gesture. Prevention: ALWAYS use `.simultaneousGesture()` when adding custom gestures to a TabView or its children.
- **Timer.scheduledTimer stops in background**: `Timer.scheduledTimer(withTimeInterval:)` uses RunLoop `.default` mode, which stops when app backgrounds. Live Activities / Dynamic Island never update. Prevention: use `Task { while !Task.isCancelled { tick(); try? await Task.sleep(for:) } }` instead — Task.sleep works with beginBackgroundTask active.
- **Async state update race causes UI flash**: Setting a `@State` variable via `await MainActor.run { }` before an async operation creates a window where UI briefly renders the intermediate state. Prevention: only set visual state variables when staying on current screen (e.g., invalid pattern → show feedback). When transitioning (valid pattern → next step), skip the intermediate state entirely.
- **Onboarding unlock transition can be consumed off-screen**: If `isUnlocked` flips while `showOnboarding` is still true, `ContentView` fires the unlock overlay during onboarding and the user sees a hard jump later. Prevention: defer `isUnlocked` until onboarding completion and run the unlock ceremony (`isLoading` delay + unlock state flip) at that moment.
- **Pending upload check OOM**: `hasPendingUpload` must never decode/load full pending SVDF blob data (e.g., `Data(contentsOf: pending_upload/svdf_data.bin)`) just to decide if resume is possible. Prevention: check metadata/state JSON + file existence only; keep all large payload reads on explicit resume/upload paths.
- **Streaming retrieve false-positive**: A code path may appear "streaming" but still load full encrypted entries if `retrieveFileToTempURL` reads entry `Data` before header parsing. Prevention: parse headers from `FileHandle` and stream decrypt directly to file.
- **Paged viewer + drag gesture conflict**: Additional drag gestures attached to a page-style `TabView` can leave horizontal swipes visually between pages. Prevention: keep page snapping isolated from custom drag-dismiss behavior or move dismiss gestures off the pager.
- **Viewer identity churn from index-keyed cover**: Using `fullScreenCover(item:)` where item id equals current photo index can cause re-presentation while swiping. Prevention: present with boolean state and keep page index separate.
- **`Task.detached` optional-self return type trap**: `Task.detached { [weak self] await self?.doWork() }` yields `Task<()?, Never>`, not `Task<Void, Never>`. Prevention: guard `self` inside the closure (`guard let self else { return }`) before invoking async work.
- **Staged import count mismatch**: `pendingFileCount` includes manifest entries whose `.enc` payload was already deleted after partial import, so UI can show stale totals and spinner-only flows. Prevention: track and present `pendingImportableFileCount` (files with existing `.enc`) and drive UI progress from per-file ingest callbacks.
- **Share screen mode snap-back**: Background refresh (`refreshUploadJobs` every second) can overwrite manually-selected UI state. In `ShareVaultView`, forcing `.manageShares` whenever uploads exist makes "Share with someone new" instantly reset. Prevention: keep `.newShare` sticky once user selects it; only auto-resolve mode from `.loading` and collapse `.manageShares` -> `.newShare` when no share data remains.
- **Terminate row keeps stale failed job**: Using `cancelUpload` for user terminate leaves cancelled/failed rows in `jobsById` and allows in-flight cleanup errors (e.g. missing `svdf_data.bin`) to surface after user termination. Prevention: user-initiated terminate must hard-remove the job, clear pending artifacts, and suppress post-cancel failure transitions.
- **Main-actor share packaging freeze**: Running `runInitialUpload`/`runResumeUpload` heavy work inside `@MainActor` `ShareUploadManager` (SVDF build, file decrypt/re-encrypt loops, chunk-hash cache writes) can freeze Share UI for seconds on "Share Vault". Prevention: move all heavy CPU/IO to detached/background tasks and keep only UI state transitions on main actor.
- **Completed upload row lingers in final state**: Leaving `.complete` jobs visible in share screen Uploads section keeps the UI in an upload-centric state after success. Prevention: hide terminal jobs (`.complete`, `.cancelled`) in view-level upload lists and refresh active share records so the screen reflects final sharing state.
- **Completed jobs retained in manager state**: Even with view filtering, keeping `.complete` jobs in `ShareUploadManager.jobsById` allows stale rows to reappear from race/order paths. Prevention: remove successful jobs from manager state at completion; active share records are the source of truth for finished shares.

## Corrections and Preferences

- **Commit frequency**: User prefers commit + push after every successful build. Don't accumulate changes.
- **Beads tracking**: Use beads for multi-session work, TodoWrite for single-session tasks.
- **Plan mode**: Make plans extremely concise. Sacrifice grammar for brevity.
- **Subagent model**: Always use opus model for subagents.
- **ASC API Key**: Key ID `GGJ9L8Y97B`, Issuer ID `3c53a69e-b7d6-4d46-a26b-2f2d02c69ccb`, key file at `~/.private_keys/AuthKey_GGJ9L8Y97B.p8`. Team ID `UFV835UGV6`.
- **TestFlight upload**: Use `xcodebuild -exportArchive` with `-authenticationKeyPath ~/.private_keys/AuthKey_GGJ9L8Y97B.p8 -authenticationKeyID GGJ9L8Y97B -authenticationKeyIssuerID 3c53a69e-b7d6-4d46-a26b-2f2d02c69ccb` and ExportOptions with `destination: upload`.
- **Appearance setting expectation**: Theme control must expose exactly `System`, `Light`, and `Dark` in App Settings and apply globally.
- **Color-tuning preference**: Keep light palette intact unless explicitly requested; adjust dark-mode tokens first when readability is the concern.
- **Release preference**: For TestFlight shipping, bump build number first and confirm ASC `processingState` reaches `VALID` before reporting completion.
- **ASC visibility preference**: After upload, verify the build row exists via `asc builds list --sort -uploadedDate` before relying on `asc builds latest --version`.
- **Upload resilience preference**: Resume pending uploads automatically when the vault opens (or app becomes active with an unlocked key), not only via a manual resume button in the share screen.
- **Release verification preference**: For TestFlight pushes, keep polling until both conditions hold: build row exists and `processingState == VALID`; do not report completion at upload success alone.
- **Share extension reliability preference**: For large share batches, checkpoint staged import manifests after each completed file so partial progress survives extension termination.
- **Crash triage preference (share extension)**: When user supplies a screen recording, extract frames and map the last stable progress label to code-path checkpoints before patching.
- **Loader consistency preference**: Dynamic Island pixel loader should be treated as a visual mirror of `PixelAnimation.loading`; if users report drift, normalize cadence/trail to in-app behavior before adding new animation logic.
- **Crash triage preference**: When a user reports a specific onboarding crash path, reproduce it with a minimal clean-state Maestro flow before implementing a fix.
- **Onboarding UX preference**: Completion path (recovery phrase saved → vault open) must show the same unlock ceremony as locked-state unlock: `LoadingView("Unlocking...")` followed by the vault-door transition.
- **Staged import UX preference**: Importing staged files from the vault banner must use the same full-screen pixel-loader progress experience as direct in-vault imports, not a banner spinner.

## Anticipated Improvements

- Always wrap `Color.accentColor` (not bare `.accentColor`) in `.foregroundStyle()` calls
- Never run Embrace SDK setup/start inside `Task.detached`; keep initialization on `@MainActor` to satisfy SDK queue assertions.
- Run `bd list` before closing issues to confirm IDs exist
- When adding optional fields to Codable structs, always provide default `nil` in init for backward compat
- When modifying grid views that feed into a full-screen viewer, verify the index mapping is global not local
- When writing CloudKit save operations with deterministic record IDs, ALWAYS use fetch-or-create pattern — never assume a record doesn't exist
- When there's an initial upload path AND a sync path for the same CloudKit records, verify the sync cache is properly seeded after initial upload
- Never use `[weak self]` in `deinit` — capture properties by value instead
- When using animated floating buttons (FAB), separate the button into its own overlay to prevent animation interference from siblings
- When using `beginBackgroundTask`, always: (1) store the ID as a property, (2) end synchronously in the expiration handler via `MainActor.assumeIsolated`, (3) end any prior task before creating a new one
- When displaying transfer/upload/sync status, always handle ALL enum cases (uploading, failed, complete, etc.) — never just the happy path
- For CloudKit chunk uploads, use `withThrowingTaskGroup` with bounded concurrency (max 4) instead of sequential loops — cuts upload time 50-70%
- When updating index/records inside a per-share loop, accumulate updates and batch-save once after the loop (avoids N+1 decrypt+encode cycles)
- Before removing a method, grep for ALL callers — if zero callers, it's dead code and can be deleted entirely
- When adding new test files to VaultTests: create PBXBuildFile + PBXFileReference with TS prefix, add to TS0000070 group children and TS00000E0 Sources phase
- Before running `xcodebuild test`, verify simulator UUID with `xcrun simctl list devices available` — prefer booted devices
- NEVER use bare `VaultIndex(files:nextOffset:totalSize:)` for new vault creation — always use `loadIndex(with:)` which handles master key + blob setup
- When cloning a screen's functionality to a new context, copy ALL behavior: validation, haptics, error messages, feedback UI — not just the data flow
- Every visual/UI change MUST include Maestro test updates — new screen = new flow, new element = accessibility ID + assertion, changed text = updated assertion
- ALL pixel loaders MUST use `PixelAnimation.loading(size:)` — never create new factory methods with different patterns or brightness. The Dynamic Island's `LivePixelGrid` is the canonical reference.
- For distribution archive: use Manual signing with `CODE_SIGN_IDENTITY[sdk=iphoneos*]` scoping so simulator builds still work
- Sentry build script phase must always be LAST (after Embed Foundation Extensions) to avoid dependency cycles
- When adding TestFlight testers: `builds add-groups` first, then `beta-testers invite`
- For certificate import on macOS: always use `-legacy` flag with openssl and a non-empty temp password
- **PHPicker pre-loading lag**: UIViewControllerRepresentable photo pickers that load all images before calling back create a visible lag. Fix: pass `PHPickerResult` array directly and process incrementally with immediate progress. Never batch-load all picker results before showing UI feedback.
- **Progress indicator timing**: Always set `importProgress` on the main actor BEFORE `Task.detached`, not inside it via `MainActor.run` — the latter introduces an async hop delay.
- **Staged import progress source**: Progress totals for staged imports should be based on importable files (existing `.enc` payloads), not raw manifest count, so retries and partially processed batches show accurate progress.
- **Manual-mode precedence**: For views with periodic background refresh, isolate mode resolution into a pure function and preserve explicit user-selected modes (for example, keeping share setup open while uploads continue).
- **Terminate flow contract**: Differentiate soft cancel (pause/resume capable) from user terminate (hard stop + immediate UI removal + background cleanup).
- **Main-thread isolation for transfer UX**: In transfer managers marked `@MainActor`, treat actor methods as orchestration only; isolate file/network/crypto pipelines into off-main helpers to avoid visible UI stalls.
- **Terminal-status presentation rule**: For long-running task dashboards, terminal rows should be removed or archived from the primary "active work" section to prevent stale success/failure clutter in steady state.
- **Upload manager source-of-truth split**: Treat upload manager as active/in-flight queue only; terminal success should move to durable share records and leave queue state.
- **RECURRING: @MainActor `await` omission**: Every time import handlers are modified, verify ALL `ShareSyncManager.shared.scheduleSync()` calls have `await`. This has regressed 3+ times. The `handleCapturedImage` path is the one that keeps losing it.
- **RECURRING: `.ignoresSafeArea(.keyboard)` on sheets with text input**: ANY `.sheet` containing TextEditor/TextField MUST have `.ignoresSafeArea(.keyboard)` on its root view. Screens to check: RecoveryPhraseInputView, JoinVaultView, SharedVaultInviteView, CustomRecoveryPhraseInputView. Parent view's `.ignoresSafeArea(.keyboard)` does NOT propagate to sheets.
- **RECURRING: sheet detent shift when keyboard appears**: On lock-screen flows, default sheet detents may re-evaluate on text focus and create a visible background jump. Prevention: pin lock-screen input sheets to `.presentationDetents([.large])` in `PatternLockView`.
- **safeAreaInset default spacing creates visible seams**: `safeAreaInset(edge: .top)` without explicit spacing can insert platform spacing between top controls and scroll content. Prevention: use `safeAreaInset(edge: .top, spacing: 0)` for contiguous header/grid layouts.
- For pending/resumable uploads, keep UI probe paths metadata-only and stream chunk IO from file URLs; never allocate full SVDF `Data` in banner/status code paths.
- **Stale pattern feedback state blocks newer errors**: In change-pattern create step, UI renders `validationResult` before `errorMessage`. If code sets one without clearing the other, old feedback persists and new errors appear "stuck". Prevention: whenever setting `errorMessage`, clear `validationResult`; whenever setting `validationResult`, clear `errorMessage`.
- For mutually exclusive feedback UI, centralize transitions in a dedicated state model and unit test precedence/reset behavior instead of duplicating branch-level state mutation.
- Prefer Maestro id/coordinate selectors over `tapOn index` in dense screens; index selectors drift as visible elements/layout shift.
- **Maestro runs installed app, not latest build output**: `xcodebuild build` alone does not update the simulator app used by Maestro. Prevention: `simctl install` the newly built `.app` before running regression flows that depend on new UI/test IDs.
- **ALWAYS use `.simultaneousGesture()` with TabView**: Never attach `.gesture()` directly to a TabView or its content — it blocks internal page swipe. Always use `.simultaneousGesture()` for custom gestures (drag-to-dismiss, etc.) coexisting with TabView paging.
- **Never use Timer.scheduledTimer for background-critical updates**: Use `Task`-based async loops with `Task.sleep(for:)` instead. Timers stop when app backgrounds (RunLoop `.default` mode). Task.sleep continues with `beginBackgroundTask`. Keep ActivityKit update rate ≤ 2/sec.
- **Async state transitions: skip intermediate state**: When a valid result triggers a screen transition after an async gap, do NOT set intermediate visual state. Only set visual state (validationResult, etc.) when the user stays on the current screen (e.g., invalid input). This prevents brief UI flashes between steps.
- **Appearance mode architecture**: Keep a single source of truth in `AppState` (`appAppearanceMode`) and apply root-level `.preferredColorScheme(...)`; avoid per-screen theme overrides.
- **Dark theme tuning workflow**: Update dark asset variants in `Assets.xcassets` (not scattered `.foregroundStyle` overrides), then validate with build/tests + settings Maestro flows.
- **TestFlight workflow hardening**: If script export fails with account-session errors, rerun export with ASC API key flags and poll `asc builds list` until new build appears.
- For build verification polling, always request latest-first ordering (`--sort -uploadedDate`) with a bounded page (`--limit 20`) so freshly uploaded versions are visible immediately.
- Keep upload continuation hooks at three layers: `beginBackgroundTask` for immediate background time, `BGProcessingTask` for deferred wakeups, and metadata-backed resume when vault key returns.
- Keep ASC poll loops bounded but long enough (>= 10 attempts at ~20s) to absorb normal indexing delays before raising failure.
- For share extension pipelines, avoid long-lived arrays of `NSItemProvider`; scan/count first, then process providers in streaming fashion so references are released sooner.
- After share-extension pipeline changes, run full simulator tests and clear test-compiler warnings (unused vars/unused helper returns) before release.
- For widget loader animation, avoid compounding multiple step sources; keep a single deterministic tick source and tune trail opacity to match in-app fade.
- When transition effects are driven by global app state (`isUnlocked`), never mutate that state while a higher-priority root route (`showOnboarding`) still masks the target screen.

### Session 4 — Fan Menu UX + CloudKit Chunk Overlap Fix (Feb 9, 2026)
- **Query**: Fix fan menu button positioning/vanishing, fix CloudKit CKError 14 "record to insert already exists" during multi-recipient share sync
- **Approach**:
  1. Fan menu: separated + button into own overlay to isolate animation context, added `.buttonStyle(.plain)` to prevent press dimming
  2. CloudKit: always fetch existing record before save (fetch-or-create pattern), handle code 14 in saveWithRetry as defense-in-depth
  3. CameraManager: fix deinit crash from weak self in async dispatch during deallocation
- **Root Causes**:
  - **Fan menu vanish**: Default ButtonStyle opacity dimming on press + `.animation` modifier leaking across ZStack siblings
  - **CKError 14**: Initial upload (`uploadSharedVault()`) creates chunks in CloudKit but never populates `ShareSyncCache`. First incremental sync reads empty `previousChunkHashes`, treats ALL chunks as new, tries INSERT on records that already exist
  - **CameraManager crash**: `deinit` called `stopSession()` which uses `[weak self]` — can't form weak ref to deallocating object
- **Key Learnings**:
  - SwiftUI `.animation(_:value:)` can leak to sibling views in same ZStack — separate into distinct overlays for isolation
  - CKRecord.save() treats new CKRecord objects as INSERT, fetched objects as UPDATE — critical distinction
  - Initial upload → incremental sync handoff has a cache gap — always defend against missing/stale cache state
  - Never use `[weak self]` in `deinit` closures — capture specific properties instead

### Session 5 — Background Task Expiration + Upload Progress Visibility (Feb 10, 2026)
- **Query**: Fix iOS background task expiration during large vault uploads; add upload status visibility to Share Vault management screen
- **Approach**:
  1. Background task: Store `currentBgTaskId` as property, use `MainActor.assumeIsolated` in expiration handler for synchronous cleanup, add `endBackgroundExecution()` idempotent helper
  2. Upload progress: Replace narrow `.uploading`-only check with `transferStatusBanner` showing `.uploading`, `.uploadFailed`, `.uploadComplete` states
  3. Added missing `beginBackgroundTask` to `startBackgroundImport`
- **Root Causes**:
  - **Background task not ended**: Expiration handler dispatched `cancel()` via `Task { @MainActor in }` — async hop may not execute before iOS suspends. `endBackgroundTask` must be called synchronously in the handler.
  - **No upload status shown**: ShareVaultView only showed progress for `.uploading` enum case. `.uploadFailed` and `.uploadComplete` had no UI — user saw nothing when upload failed.
  - **Missing background task**: `startBackgroundImport` had no `beginBackgroundTask` at all — iOS could suspend during import.
- **Key Learnings**:
  - `UIApplication.beginBackgroundTask` expiration handler runs on main queue — use `MainActor.assumeIsolated` for synchronous @MainActor access without async hop
  - Must call `endBackgroundTask` before expiration handler returns, not via async dispatch
  - Multiple `beginBackgroundTask` calls without matching `endBackgroundTask` = orphaned task IDs
  - Always show ALL non-idle transfer states in UI, not just the "happy path" uploading state

### Session 7 — Unit Test Infrastructure (Feb 10, 2026)
- **Query**: Add VaultTests unit test target + initial test coverage for crypto/sharing layers
- **Approach**: Create VaultTests target via pbxproj edits (TS prefix IDs), 4 test suites, @testable import Vault with TEST_HOST
- **Files created**: VaultTests/CryptoEngineTests.swift, SVDFSerializerTests.swift, ShareSyncCacheTests.swift, SharedVaultDataTests.swift
- **Files modified**: project.pbxproj (TS prefix entries), Vault.xcscheme (Testables section)
- **Result**: 32 tests, 0 failures, all pass in 0.044s
- **Errors**:
  - Stale simulator UUID: `57965726-...` was deleted, test launch failed with "Unable to boot deleted device". Fix: use `xcrun simctl list devices available` to find live simulators, use booted one (`6627B57F-...`)
  - SourceKit "No such module XCTest" — false positive before test target exists, ignore per Error Tracker
- **Key Learnings**:
  - Test target needs: PBXBuildFile, PBXFileReference, PBXGroup, PBXSourcesBuildPhase, PBXFrameworksBuildPhase, PBXResourcesBuildPhase, PBXNativeTarget, PBXContainerItemProxy, PBXTargetDependency, XCBuildConfiguration (Debug+Release), XCConfigurationList, plus updates to mainGroup, Products, TargetAttributes, targets array
  - `BUNDLE_LOADER = "$(TEST_HOST)"` + `TEST_HOST = "$(BUILT_PRODUCTS_DIR)/Vault.app/$(BUNDLE_EXECUTABLE_FOLDER_PATH)/Vault"` — test bundle loads into host app, `@testable import Vault` works without sharing source files
  - Always check `xcrun simctl list devices available` for booted simulator before running tests — stale UUIDs fail silently

### Session 6 — Code Review: Quality + Performance Fixes (Feb 10, 2026)
- **Query**: Interactive 4-section code review of sharing/transfer code (Architecture → Code Quality → Tests → Performance)
- **Approach**: Systematic review with user-approved fixes per section
- **Code Quality Fixes**:
  - Removed dead `startBackgroundImport` (zero callers, 80 lines)
  - Removed unused `pattern: [Int]` param from import method
  - Added Sentry error capture to import error path
  - Extracted `saveChunkRecord` helper in CloudKitSharingManager (DRY 3x)
- **Performance Fixes**:
  - Parallel chunk uploads (max 4 concurrent) via `withThrowingTaskGroup` with bounded concurrency
  - Batched index save after sync loop (was N+1 loads)
- **Key Learnings**:
  - `withThrowingTaskGroup` concurrency limiting pattern: check `inFlight >= max` before each `addTask`, call `try await group.next()` to drain one slot
  - CloudKit public database handles 4 concurrent saves well; `saveWithRetry` handles rate limiting as fallback
  - Dead code detection: grep for method name, verify zero callers before removing
  - N+1 pattern in loops: accumulate updates, batch-write after loop

### Session 8 — Resumable Uploads (Feb 10, 2026)
- **Query**: Implement resumable upload system so large vault shares survive app backgrounding
- **Approach**: Persist SVDF data + upload metadata to disk before CloudKit upload; on resume, query CloudKit for existing chunks, upload only missing ones
- **Files modified**: CloudKitSharingManager.swift (existingChunkIndices, saveManifest extraction, uploadChunksParallel → internal), BackgroundShareTransferManager.swift (PendingUploadState, save/load/clear, resumePendingUpload), ShareVaultView.swift (Resume Upload button)
- **Result**: Build succeeded first attempt, 314 lines added, committed and pushed
- **Errors**: Duplicate simulator name (lowercase "iphone 17 pro" + uppercase "iPhone 17 Pro") — used UUID directly per Error Tracker
- **Key Learnings**:
  - `nonisolated static` methods on `@MainActor` class for file I/O called from `Task.detached` — avoids actor isolation issues
  - `CKQueryOperation.Cursor` from `publicDatabase.records(matching:)` result enables pagination — check `queryCursor` after each page
  - Extracting methods from complex functions: keep the original call site clean, move error capture/transaction logic to the caller
  - PendingUploadState uses JSON for metadata + raw binary for SVDF blob — keeps serialization simple and avoids base64 bloat

### Session 9 — Maestro E2E Test Infrastructure (Feb 10, 2026)
- **Query**: Implement Maestro E2E test coverage plan (3 phases: test mode bypass, accessibility identifiers, YAML flows)
- **Approach**: `#if DEBUG` TEST_MODE bypass with deterministic SHA-256 key, accessibilityIdentifier on all interactive elements across 15 views, 30 YAML flow files in `maestro/` directory
- **Files modified**: VaultApp.swift (AppState test mode + deterministic key), ContentView.swift (auto-unlock + lock bypass), 13 view files (accessibilityIdentifiers)
- **Files created**: maestro/ directory with config.yaml, 3 test media files, 30 YAML flow files across 10 categories
- **Result**: Build succeeded first attempt, 945 lines added across 56 files, committed and pushed
- **Errors**: Duplicate simulator name again (lowercase "iphone 17 pro") — used UUID per Error Tracker
- **Key Learnings**:
  - `ProcessInfo.processInfo.arguments.contains("-MAESTRO_TEST")` detects Maestro launch args in iOS
  - Deterministic test key via `CryptoKit.SHA256.hash(data: fixedSeed)` bypasses PBKDF2+SecureEnclave for automated testing
  - Lock trigger bypass: screenshot/screenRecording/background notifications all need early-return guards
  - Maestro `runFlow` uses relative paths from the YAML file location
  - `addMedia` pushes files to simulator photo library — works for photo import tests
  - FanItem struct needed `accessibilityId` optional field for per-item identifiers
  - Accessibility identifiers go on the interactive element itself, not a containing wrapper

### Session 10 — Maestro Flow Runtime Fixes (Feb 10, 2026)
- **Query**: Run Maestro flows on simulator, fix failures
- **Approach**: Iterative run → diagnose → fix → re-run for all 30 flows across 8 directories
- **Files modified**: VaultApp.swift (onboarding bypass, MAESTRO_SEED_FILES), launch_test_mode.yaml, navigate_to_app_settings.yaml, 22 YAML flow files
- **Files created**: launch_with_files.yaml (helper with seed files), testdata symlinks
- **Result**: 29/30 flows passing (96.7%). Only import_from_library fails (system photo picker limitation)
- **Errors**:
  - Java not linked: `JAVA_HOME="/opt/homebrew/opt/openjdk@17"` needed for Maestro CLI
  - Onboarding reappears: `clearState: true` resets UserDefaults → auto-set `hasCompletedOnboarding` in test mode
  - Apple Account Verification dialog: `clearKeychain: true` triggers persistent system dialog → removed, added "Not Now" dismiss
  - `wait: N` invalid: Maestro has no `wait` command → use `waitForAnimationToEnd: timeout: N000`
  - `addMedia` no parent paths: `../testdata/` fails → moved testdata into flows/, created per-directory symlinks
  - FAB not in empty state: `vault_add_button` hidden when files empty → use `vault_first_files` + confirmationDialog
  - `clearInput` invalid: → use `eraseText: charactersToErase: N`
  - Premium elements hidden: duress toggle/iCloud backup gated by subscription → scroll to visible text, tap either toggle or button
  - Settings below fold: `settings_app_settings` needs `scrollUntilVisible` before tap
- **Key Learnings**:
  - Maestro `addMedia` resolves paths relative to the YAML file only — no `../` parent traversal
  - Maestro has no `wait` or `clearInput` commands — use `waitForAnimationToEnd` and `eraseText`
  - Maestro doesn't recurse subdirectories — must run per-directory: `maestro test maestro/flows/core/`
  - System photo picker (PHPickerViewController) is unreliable in Maestro — make picker steps optional
  - For flows needing files in vault, use `-MAESTRO_SEED_FILES` launch arg + `UIGraphicsImageRenderer` to generate test images programmatically
  - `clearState: true` resets ALL UserDefaults — any test mode init must re-set required defaults
  - `clearKeychain: true` triggers Apple Account Verification — avoid in test mode
  - Premium-gated UI: use `scrollUntilVisible` with text match + optional taps for both premium/non-premium states

### Session 11 — Link-Based Vault Sharing (Feb 10, 2026)
- **Query**: Implement share-via-link feature — encode phrase into URL fragment, deep link handler, invite landing screen, Copy Link + Share buttons
- **Approach**: 3 new files (ShareLinkEncoder, DeepLinkHandler, SharedVaultInviteView) + modifications to 5 existing files (entitlements, VaultApp, ContentView, ShareVaultView, pbxproj)
- **Files created**: ShareLinkEncoder.swift (base58 + deflate compression), DeepLinkHandler.swift (@Observable URL handler), SharedVaultInviteView.swift (invite flow with pattern setup)
- **Files modified**: Vault.entitlements (associated domains), VaultApp.swift (DeepLinkHandler + onOpenURL), ContentView.swift (fullScreenCover for invite), ShareVaultView.swift (Copy Link + Share buttons with 60s auto-clear), project.pbxproj (SL prefix IDs)
- **Result**: Build succeeded first attempt, 543 lines added across 9 files, committed and pushed
- **Errors**: Duplicate simulator name again — used UUID per Error Tracker
- **Key Learnings**:
  - Apple's `Compression` framework provides `compression_encode_buffer`/`compression_decode_buffer` for deflate — no need for third-party zlib wrappers
  - Base58 encoding (Bitcoin alphabet) naturally excludes ambiguous characters (0, O, I, l) — ideal for URL-safe phrase encoding
  - URL fragments (#...) never reach the server — safe for client-side secrets in share links
  - `fullScreenCover` with computed `Binding` on an observable property works well for showing deep-link-triggered sheets regardless of app lock state
  - SharedVaultInviteView mirrors JoinVaultView pattern: invite → premium check → pattern setup → empty index → unlock → background download
  - `.interactiveDismissDisabled()` prevents accidental swipe-dismiss during invite flow

### Session 12 — Monorepo Restructure (Feb 10, 2026)
- **Query**: Restructure repo from single iOS project to monorepo with apps/ios/, web/, shared docs/
- **Approach**: git mv iOS files to apps/ios/, split docs (iOS-specific → apps/ios/docs/, project-wide stays at docs/), scaffold web/ with AASA + landing pages + Tailwind, create scoped AGENTS.md files
- **Files moved**: 150+ files via git mv (Vault.xcodeproj, Vault/, VaultLiveActivity/, VaultTests/, maestro/ → apps/ios/)
- **Files created**: apps/ios/AGENTS.md (iOS-scoped), web/AGENTS.md, web/index.html, web/s/index.html, web/.well-known/apple-app-site-association, web/package.json, web/styles/input.css
- **Files modified**: AGENTS.md (trimmed to monorepo-level), .gitignore (web ignores)
- **Result**: Build succeeded first attempt from apps/ios/, beads still works from root
- **Errors**:
  - `git mv VaultUITests` failed — empty dir not tracked by git. Fix: plain `mv` for untracked dirs
  - `git mv .sentryclirc` failed — gitignored file. Fix: plain `mv`
  - `&&` chain break: first failure aborts remaining commands. Partial state required checking what already moved.
- **Key Learnings**:
  - Xcode `sourceTree = "<group>"` relative refs mean moving .xcodeproj + siblings together requires NO pbxproj edits
  - `git mv` can't move empty dirs or gitignored files — use plain `mv` for those
  - sentry-cli discovers `.sentryclirc` by walking up from CWD — placing it next to .xcodeproj keeps it discoverable
  - Tailwind CSS v4 uses `@import "tailwindcss"` instead of v3's `@tailwind` directives
  - AASA file must have no extension but serve as `application/json`

### Session 13 — Join Vault Bug Fixes + Download Progress (Feb 10, 2026)
- **Query**: Fix 3 bugs in Join Shared Vault flow: invisible text area, "Setup Failed" crash, missing pattern validation. Add download progress indicator.
- **Approach**: Traced each bug to root cause, applied minimal fixes matching existing patterns in onboarding/settings screens
- **Root Causes**:
  - **Invisible text area**: TextEditor missing `.overlay(RoundedRectangle.stroke())` border that all other phrase inputs have
  - **"Setup Failed" on import**: `setupSharedVault()` manually created bare `VaultIndex` (v1 init, no `encryptedMasterKey`). Background import called `storeFile()` → `getMasterKey()` → `guard let encryptedMasterKey` → throws `corruptedData`. Fix: use `loadIndex(with:)` which auto-creates proper v3 index with master key + blob when none exists
  - **No pattern validation**: `handlePatternComplete` only checked `count >= 6`, skipping `PatternValidator` (no validation feedback, no haptics, no error on mismatch). Fix: mirror `PatternSetupView` exactly — full validation, visual feedback, haptics, "Patterns don't match" error with auto-clear
- **Download progress**: Exposed `displayProgress`/`currentMessage` from `BackgroundShareTransferManager` (changed `private` → `private(set)`). Added `importingProgressView` to VaultView empty state — shows PixelAnimation.downloading + ProgressView bar + percentage + status message when `transferManager.status == .importing`
- **Maestro tests**: Expanded `join_vault.yaml` (phrase input + pattern setup assertions), created `join_vault_pattern_validation.yaml` (mismatch error + start over flow). Added accessibility IDs: `join_pattern_grid`, `join_pattern_error`, `join_pattern_start_over`
- **Rule added**: Mandatory Maestro test section in `apps/ios/AGENTS.md` — every visual/UI change MUST include corresponding test updates
- **Key Learnings**:
  - `VaultIndex` has two inits: v1 (no master key — for legacy/bare use) and v2+ (with `encryptedMasterKey`). Using v1 init then saving creates a real index file, which prevents `loadIndex` from auto-creating a proper v3 index later. Always use `loadIndex` for new vault creation — it handles master key generation, blob setup, and versioning automatically
  - When a new screen replicates functionality from an existing screen (join vault pattern ↔ onboarding pattern), copy the FULL behavior including validation, haptics, error messages, and feedback UI — not just the happy path
  - `private(set)` on `@Observable` properties is the clean way to expose read-only progress to views without breaking encapsulation

### Session 14 — TestFlight Distribution Pipeline (Feb 10, 2026)
- **Query**: Set up full TestFlight pipeline — from zero distribution assets to first build on TestFlight
- **Approach**: Register missing bundle ID, create distribution cert + profiles, configure manual signing for Release, fix build phase cycle, archive + export + upload, create beta group + invite tester
- **Files created**: ExportOptions.plist, scripts/publish-testflight.sh
- **Files modified**: project.pbxproj (Release signing → manual, build phase reorder)
- **ASC artifacts**: Distribution cert (6DBP6XL5J5), 3 App Store profiles, "Internal Testers" group, build v1.0(1) uploaded
- **Errors**:
  - `asc bundle-ids create --platform UNIVERSAL` rejected — must use `IOS` (ASC API converts to UNIVERSAL internally)
  - `security import` with empty password fails on macOS — use `openssl pkcs12 -legacy` with temp password
  - `xcodebuild archive` with `CODE_SIGN_STYLE=Automatic` fails without registered devices — Xcode tries to create Development profiles which require devices even for distribution builds
  - Sentry script build phase before Embed Foundation Extensions causes cycle — dSYM input dependency creates circular reference with extension embedding
  - `asc testflight beta-testers invite` fails with "no installable builds" until build is added to group via `asc builds add-groups`
- **Key Learnings**:
  - **Manual signing for Release is required** when no devices are registered — automatic signing tries to create Development profiles (need devices) even for distribution archive
  - `CODE_SIGN_IDENTITY[sdk=iphoneos*]` and `PROVISIONING_PROFILE_SPECIFIER[sdk=iphoneos*]` scope signing to device builds only — simulator builds still work with default ad-hoc signing
  - `openssl pkcs12 -legacy` flag needed for macOS Keychain import compatibility
  - Sentry dSYM upload script must be AFTER Embed Foundation Extensions in build phases to avoid dependency cycle
  - `xcodebuild -exportArchive` with `destination: upload` in ExportOptions.plist uploads directly to ASC — no IPA file produced locally
  - `-allowProvisioningUpdates` only needed on exportArchive step, not archive step with manual signing
  - Build processing takes ~1-2 minutes in ASC before `VALID` state
  - Must `asc builds add-groups` before testers can be invited — group needs a build first
  - Internal testers (ASC team members) use `invite` not `add` command

### Session 15 — Import UX, Free Tier Enforcement, Unlock Animation, Drag-to-Select, TestFlight (Feb 11, 2026)
- **Queries**: 7 sequential requests: (1) fix import progress lag, (2) enforce free tier 100-file limit during import, (3) standardize unlock animation to 1.5s, (4) icon overlay to 0.9s, (5) drag-to-select in edit mode, (6) fix recurring Swift 6 async warning, (7) deploy to TestFlight
- **Approach**: Each change committed and pushed individually after build verification
- **Files modified**: VaultView.swift (import progress, free tier limits, async fix), PhotosGridView.swift (drag-to-select), FilesGridView.swift (drag-to-select), VaultApp.swift (unlock timing), ContentView.swift (shield overlay timing), project.pbxproj (build number bump)
- **Root Causes**:
  - **Import lag**: PHPicker Coordinator loaded ALL images via `loadObject` before calling back. Fix: pass `[PHPickerResult]` directly, set `importProgress` immediately on main actor
  - **Broken vault state**: Free tier limit only checked at + button, not during import. `storeFile` threw `expansionNotAllowed` silently. Fix: cap imports to remaining free slots, import those, show paywall if truncated
  - **Swift 6 async warning**: `handleCapturedImage` path missing `await` on `@MainActor` singleton call (3rd time this regressed)
- **Errors**:
  - `asc builds add-groups` fails for internal groups — internal groups with `hasAccessToAllBuilds: true` auto-receive all builds
- **Key Learnings**:
  - PreferenceKey + simultaneousGesture + direction detection is the pattern for drag-to-select in SwiftUI LazyVGrid
  - Replace `Button` with `.onTapGesture` when adding simultaneous drag gestures (Button consumes the gesture)
  - Internal TestFlight groups auto-receive builds — no `add-groups` needed
  - Free tier enforcement must happen at import handler level, not just UI button level

### Session 16 — Free Tier Alert, Video Import, Quick Look, Paywall Fallback, Unified Grid (Feb 11, 2026)
- **Queries**: 7 sequential requests: (1) fix 100-file limit silent truncation with alert dialog, (2) fix video import from gallery, (3) fix date header overlap, (4) add Quick Look for non-image files, (5) fix RevenueCat Error 23 with fallback paywall, (6) unified Files-app grid for mixed content, (7) deploy build 6 to TestFlight
- **Approach**: Each fix committed individually; unified grid was the most complex change
- **Files modified**: VaultView.swift (limit alert, video import, date header padding), FilesGridView.swift (thumbnailOrIcon, masterKey param), SecureImageViewer.swift (Quick Look rewrite), PaywallTrigger.swift (fallback paywall), SubscriptionManager.swift (hasOfferings check)
- **Root Causes**:
  - **94 files instead of 100**: PHPicker allows images+videos, but `handleSelectedPhotos` only processed UIImage. 6 videos silently skipped via `canLoadObject(ofClass: UIImage.self)` check
  - **Silent truncation**: No user feedback when import was capped. Fix: PendingImport enum + 3-option alert (Import N, Upgrade, Cancel)
  - **Video silent fail**: `loadObject(ofClass: UIImage.self)` fails for video items. Fix: `UTType.movie` detection + `loadFileRepresentation` + `AVAssetImageGenerator` thumbnails
  - **Date header overlap**: `LazyVStack(spacing: 0)` with pinned headers left zero gap. Fix: `.padding(.top, 8)` on section content
  - **Unsupported file type**: SecureImageViewer only handled UIImage. Fix: QLPreviewController for non-image files via UIViewControllerRepresentable
  - **RevenueCat Error 23**: Offerings not configured. Fix: `hasOfferings` check → FallbackPaywallView with premium override for sandbox
  - **Inconsistent grid**: PhotosGridView (tight) + FilesGridView (icon tiles) side by side. Fix: FilesGridView accepts optional masterKey, shows AsyncThumbnailView for files with thumbnails
- **Key Learnings**:
  - `NSItemProvider.loadFileRepresentation(forTypeIdentifier:)` provides a temp URL — must copy data before callback returns
  - `AVAssetImageGenerator.copyCGImage(at:actualTime:)` grabs frame at specific time — write video to temp file first
  - QLPreviewController via UIViewControllerRepresentable works for all file types iOS supports
  - RevenueCat `Purchases.shared.offerings()` returns nil current when no products configured — check before showing PaywallView
  - Unified grid pattern: FilesGridView with optional masterKey, `thumbnailOrIcon` method switches between AsyncThumbnailView and icon fallback
  - "Photos" filter → PhotosGridView (compact), all other filters → FilesGridView (uniform tiles with thumbnails)

### Session 17 — Scroll Fix, Security Fix, Batch Delete, Camera Preview, Media Filter, Builds 7-9 (Feb 11, 2026)
- **Queries**: 8 sequential requests: (1) verify scroll fix + push, (2) deploy build 7 to TestFlight, (3) prevent phone sleep during imports, (4) deploy build 8, (5) default to Media filter, (6) critical security fix — cross-vault import contamination, (7) batch delete optimization, (8) camera preview fix, (9) deploy build 9
- **Approach**: Each fix committed and pushed individually; 3 TestFlight deployments across session
- **Files modified**: VaultView.swift (media filter, security fix, batch delete, idle timer), FilesGridView.swift (scroll fix), PhotosGridView.swift (scroll fix), VaultStorage.swift (batch deleteFiles), SecureCameraView.swift (camera preview), ShareExtension/Info.plist (build setting vars), Supporting/Info.plist (build bumps 6→9), project.pbxproj (build bumps)
- **Root Causes**:
  - **Scroll blocked**: `DragGesture(minimumDistance: 1)` via `.simultaneousGesture()` always attached, competing with ScrollView pan. Fix: conditionally attach only when `isEditing`
  - **Phone sleep during imports**: No idle timer management. Fix: `UIApplication.shared.isIdleTimerDisabled = true/false` around import/delete operations
  - **Cross-vault contamination (CRITICAL)**: `Task.detached` captures vault key by value (Data), keeps running after lock. `lockVault()` has no task cancellation. `onChange` only clears on nil, not vault switch. Fix: store task handles, cancel on any key change, check `Task.isCancelled` throughout import loops
  - **Batch delete freeze**: Each `deleteFile` did separate `loadIndex`/`saveIndex` — 300 cycles for 300 files, ran on main thread. Fix: batch `deleteFiles` method (single load/save, blob-grouped file handles), `Task.detached`, progress bar
  - **Camera black preview**: `AVCaptureVideoPreviewLayer` added as sublayer with zero frame. Fix: `layerClass` override pattern — backing layer auto-resizes
  - **ShareExtension version drift**: Hardcoded build number "6" in Info.plist. Fix: `$(CURRENT_PROJECT_VERSION)` and `$(MARKETING_VERSION)` variables
- **Errors**:
  - `defer` can't contain `await` — moved idle timer re-enable to explicit MainActor.run blocks
  - `blobId` is `String?` — used `entry.blobId ?? "primary"` for dictionary grouping
  - ShareExtension build number mismatch broke archive — replaced with build setting variables
  - `asc builds test-notes create` duplicate locale error — used `update` instead
- **Key Learnings**:
  - Swift `defer` cannot contain `await` expressions — use explicit cleanup at return points
  - `Task.detached` captured value-type keys (`Data`) survive vault lock — MUST store task handles and check `Task.isCancelled` for security
  - `onChange(of:)` should handle ANY value change for security-critical state, not just nil transitions
  - Batch storage operations: load index once, group by blob for file handle reuse, save once = 300x fewer crypto cycles
  - `AVCaptureVideoPreviewLayer` as `layerClass` override is Apple's recommended pattern — auto-resizes with view, no manual frame management needed
  - ShareExtension Info.plist should use `$(CURRENT_PROJECT_VERSION)` / `$(MARKETING_VERSION)` to stay in sync with main app
  - `asc testflight beta-details get` shows `internalBuildState: IN_BETA_TESTING` when auto-notify is enabled — no manual group assignment needed for internal testers

### Session 19 — Replace Debug Prints with Structured os.log (Feb 11, 2026)
- **Query**: VAULT-x68 — Replace ~80 `#if DEBUG / print() / #endif` blocks with Apple's unified `os.log` Logger across the entire codebase
- **Approach**: Searched for all `#if DEBUG` blocks, identified 18 Swift files needing changes (excluded VaultStorage.swift, iCloudBackupManager.swift, VaultView.swift per instructions). Added Logger instances following subsystem/category pattern, replaced prints with appropriate log levels.
- **Files modified**: 18 files — VaultApp.swift, ContentView.swift, SubscriptionManager.swift, PatternSetupView.swift, VaultSettingsView.swift, SettingsView.swift, CloudKitSharingManager.swift, ShareVaultView.swift, DeepLinkHandler.swift, ShareSyncManager.swift, PatternGridView.swift, PatternLockView.swift, LocalNotificationManager.swift, ImportIngestor.swift, RecoveryPhraseView.swift, DuressHandler.swift, GridLetterManager.swift, RecoveryPhraseManager.swift
- **Security**: 5 sensitive data leaks found and addressed — 3 `key.hashValue` prints changed to `logger.trace()` with no key data, 2 recovery phrase prints removed/trace-only, 1 duress recovery phrase print removed entirely
- **Errors**:
  - `@MainActor`-isolated `private static let logger` on ShareSyncManager accessed from `nonisolated static` method. Fix: moved to file-level `private let shareSyncLogger` outside the class
  - Pre-existing unused variable `let newPhrase = ...` in VaultSettingsView after removing the print that used it. Fix: changed to `_ = ...`
- **Key Learnings**:
  - Logger placement: `private static let` for classes/actors (accessed via `Self.logger`), file-level `private let` for structs/enums/views
  - `@MainActor` class static properties cannot be accessed from `nonisolated` context — use file-level let instead
  - Per-frame drag logging (called every gesture event) must be removed, not converted — would flood os.log
  - Sensitive data in logs: `key.hashValue` and recovery phrases should use `.trace()` or be removed entirely
  - Some `#if DEBUG` blocks are functional gates (Maestro test mode), not logging — keep those intact

### Session 20 — Code Review Implementation Wave 4 + TestFlight Build 15 (Feb 11, 2026)
- **Query**: Continue implementing remaining beads issues from 16-item code review, push to TestFlight
- **Approach**: Implemented 5 remaining issues (VAULT-zhw P0, VAULT-mn7 P1, VAULT-3os P2, VAULT-rlu P2, VAULT-x68 P3) using parallel subagents for non-overlapping changes
- **Issues completed**:
  - VAULT-zhw: Replaced `Data(contentsOf: blobURL)` + `CryptoEngine.encrypt()` with `CryptoEngine.encryptStreaming(fileURL:originalSize:with:)` — halves peak memory for iCloud backup
  - VAULT-mn7: Fixed 5 critical `try?` paths — zeroed XOR key fallback → CryptoKit SymmetricKey; silent duress setup → Sentry error capture; silent file deletion → Sentry capture; silent recovery data destroy → do/catch
  - VAULT-3os: Parallel chunk downloads via `downloadChunksParallel` with bounded TaskGroup (max 4 concurrent), order-preserving reassembly
  - VAULT-rlu: VaultView decomposed from 1500→487 lines into 5 extension files (+Grid, +Toolbar, +FanMenu, +SharedVault, +Actions)
  - VAULT-x68: 18 files migrated from `#if DEBUG print()` to structured os.log Logger (via subagent)
- **Subagent coordination**: 3 parallel agents (downloads, os.log, VaultView extraction) working on non-overlapping files. All completed successfully.
- **Errors**:
  - `SentryManager.captureError` takes only `Error`, not `(Error, context:)` — fixed by removing context param
  - os.log agent hit `@MainActor` static logger in `nonisolated` method — fixed with file-level logger
  - `xcodebuild -exportArchive` with `destination: upload` requires App Store Connect API key — no key configured, used Xcode Organizer instead
- **Key Learnings**:
  - `CryptoEngine.encryptStreaming` reads via FileHandle in 256KB chunks — essential for large blobs
  - `Data(repeating: 0, count: 16)` as crypto fallback is a security vulnerability — always use CryptoKit entropy
  - `try?` on security-critical operations (duress vault setup, file deletion) gives false sense of success
  - Parallel subagents work well when files don't overlap — os.log, VaultView extensions, and CloudKit downloads all isolated
  - `xcodebuild -exportArchive` without `destination: upload` exports IPA locally; with it, needs ASC API key auth

### Session 18 — Pattern Board Normalization + UI Consistency (Feb 11, 2026)
- **Queries**: Fix ChangePatternView UI (error position, grid jumping, missing action buttons), replace onboarding logo, remove/re-add validation feedback, normalize all pattern boards
- **Approach**: Investigated all 7 pattern board screens (PatternLockView, PatternSetupView, ChangePatternView, JoinVaultView, SharedVaultInviteView, RestoreFromBackupView, PatternInputView), identified inconsistencies, normalized to match PatternSetupView as reference implementation
- **Root Causes**:
  - **Grid jumping**: Different subtitle text lengths + different number of bottom buttons across steps changed Spacer distribution. Fix: `.frame(height: 44, alignment: .top)` on subtitle, `.hidden()` placeholder buttons
  - **Error at wrong position**: Error message was between title and grid instead of below grid. Fix: moved to fixed 80pt Group below grid (matching PatternSetupView)
  - **Missing validation on createNew**: Removed validation feedback (user asked to remove "flash"), but that also removed error display for invalid patterns. Fix: re-added `validationResult` + `validationFeedback` function matching PatternSetupView exactly
  - **SharedVaultInviteView incomplete**: Only checked `count >= 6`, no PatternValidator, no error messages, silently reset on confirm mismatch. Fix: added full PatternValidator validation, feedback area, "Patterns don't match" error
- **Files modified**: VaultSettingsView.swift (ChangePatternView — 3 rounds of fixes), SharedVaultInviteView.swift (added validation + feedback), AGENTS.md (pattern board rules), .scratch-pad.md
- **Key Learnings**:
  - Removing UI that "flashes" may actually remove essential feedback — understand WHY it flashes before removing. The flash was because valid patterns immediately transition to next step.
  - SwiftUI layout stability requires fixed heights for ALL variable-content areas: subtitles, feedback sections, button stacks
  - Pattern board screens have 3 categories (create, confirm, enter-existing) each with specific required behaviors — documented in AGENTS.md
  - When user says "remove this" about a specific UI element, clarify whether they mean (a) remove the feature entirely, or (b) fix the specific problem (flash/position/style)
- **Error**: Prematurely removed validation feedback from ChangePatternView when user only wanted the brief flash fixed. Re-added with proper behavior.

### Session 21 — Video Performance: Import Speed, Duration Badge, Playback, Viewer Fix (Feb 13, 2026)
- **Query**: Fix 4 video issues: FullScreenPhotoViewer infinite spinner, no duration badge, slow import (entire file in memory), slow playback
- **Approach**: Bottom-up implementation — CryptoEngine (new methods) → VaultStorage (duration field, URL-based methods) → VaultView (duration, masterKey) → VaultView+Actions (URL import) → FullScreenPhotoViewer (video support) → SecureVideoPlayer (stream decrypt) → PhotosGridView (badge)
- **Root Causes**:
  - **Viewer spinner**: `loadFullImage` only handled `image/` mimeType — videos silently failed the guard, leaving permanent ProgressView
  - **No duration**: VaultFileEntry/LightweightFileEntry/VaultFileItem had no duration field
  - **Slow import**: `loadVideoData` loaded entire video into RAM via `Data(contentsOf:)`, then `storeFile` encrypted entire blob in single shot
  - **Slow playback**: `retrieveFile` read+decrypted entire file to Data, then wrote Data to temp file
- **Changes (7 files, +453/-114 lines)**:
  - CryptoEngine: `encryptFileFromURL` (reads via FileHandle, VCSE for >1MB), `decryptFileToTempURL` + `decryptStreamingToFile` (stream-decrypt 256KB chunks to file), `decryptFile` now uses `decryptStaged` for backward compat
  - VaultStorage: `duration: TimeInterval?` in VaultFileEntry (both inits) + LightweightFileEntry, `storeFileFromURL` (URL-based encryption), `retrieveFileToTempURL` (stream-decrypt to temp), updated deleteFile/deleteFiles/compactBlobs to preserve duration
  - VaultView: `duration` in VaultFileItem, pass `masterKey` to FullScreenPhotoViewer
  - VaultView+Actions: `loadVideoURL` (copies to temp dir, returns URL), `generateVideoMetadata` (thumbnail + duration from URL), restructured `performPhotoImport` video path (URL-based), updated `performFileImport` for video URLs
  - FullScreenPhotoViewer: `masterKey` param, video thumbnail decryption, play button overlay, SecureVideoPlayer via `.fullScreenCover`
  - SecureVideoPlayer: `retrieveFileToTempURL` replaces `retrieveFile` + manual temp write
  - PhotosGridView: duration badge overlay with `formatDuration` helper
- **Errors**: None — first-attempt build success
- **Key Learnings**:
  - Adding optional fields to Codable structs with `nil` defaults is backward compatible — auto-synthesized decoder treats missing keys as nil
  - `provider.loadFileRepresentation` provides ephemeral URLs — must `FileManager.copyItem` before callback returns
  - `AVAsset.load(.duration)` is the async way to get video duration (returns CMTime), use `CMTimeGetSeconds` + `isFinite` guard
  - Duration badge goes `bottomLeading` to avoid collision with edit mode selection circle at `bottomTrailing`
  - `NSItemProvider.suggestedName` often lacks extension — use temp URL's extension or explicit fallback
  - When restructuring a loop that had shared tuple assignment, splitting into separate `if/else` branches with their own storage calls is cleaner than variable-scoping gymnastics

### Session 22 — 50MB Blob + Multi-Blob Backup + Paywall Button Fix (Feb 13, 2026)
- **Queries**: (1) Implement 6-change plan: reduce blob from 500MB→50MB, multi-blob iCloud backup with chunked uploads, (2) CloudKit Dashboard instructions, (3) deploy build 25, (4) fix paywall button lag
- **Approach**: Sequential implementation of all 6 changes, then investigated paywall lag root cause
- **Changes (7 files, ~600 lines)**:
  - VaultStorage.swift: `defaultBlobSize` 50MB, `cursorFooterOffset()` for legacy blob compat, `secureOverwrite(url:)` for variable-size wipe
  - iCloudBackupManager.swift: Full v2 multi-blob payload format, chunked upload/download (max 4 concurrent), backward-compat restore
  - Tests + 4 doc files updated
- **Paywall fix**: `AnalyticsManager.setEnabled()` used `Task { @MainActor in }` which ran `TelemetryDeck.initialize()` synchronously on main actor during analytics→paywall transition. Changed to `Task.detached(priority: .utility)` so all SDK init runs off main thread.
- **Errors**:
  - `xcodebuild -exportArchive` with `destination: upload` failed with "Failed to Use Accounts" — removed `destination` key, exported IPA locally, uploaded via `asc builds upload`
- **Key Learnings**:
  - `cursorFooterOffset()` pattern: derive cursor position from actual file size, not the constant — handles legacy 500MB blobs after `defaultBlobSize` changes to 50MB
  - `secureOverwrite()` must use actual file size, not `defaultBlobSize` — old 500MB blobs would only get first 50MB wiped
  - Analytics SDK init (`TelemetryDeck.initialize()`, `SentrySDK.start()`) should ALWAYS use `Task.detached` — main-actor initialization blocks UI transitions
  - `xcodebuild -exportArchive` without `destination: upload` in ExportOptions exports IPA locally; upload separately via `asc builds upload`

### Session 23 — Gallery UX, Photo Viewer Paging, Dynamic Island, Keyboard Sheet, Date Grouping, Build 30 (Feb 14, 2026)
- **Queries**: 6 sequential fixes: (1) photo viewer paging stuck between swipes, (2) change pattern validation flash between steps 2→3, (3) Dynamic Island not updating when backgrounded, (4) date grouping replace "Today/Earlier" with per-day groups + section spacing, (5) keyboard pushes sheet background up (recurring), (6) deploy build 30 to TestFlight
- **Approach**: Each fix investigated for root cause, minimal targeted fix, build verification
- **Files modified**: FullScreenPhotoViewer.swift (.simultaneousGesture), VaultView+Toolbar.swift (header background), VaultSettingsView.swift (validation flash), BackgroundShareTransferManager.swift (Timer→Task), VaultView.swift (date grouping), VaultView+Grid.swift (section spacing + sort), PatternLockView.swift (.ignoresSafeArea), JoinVaultView.swift (.ignoresSafeArea), project.pbxproj (build 30)
- **Root Causes**:
  - **Photo viewer stuck**: `.gesture(dragToDissmissGesture)` on TabView consumes gesture, blocking page swipe. Fix: `.simultaneousGesture()` allows both drag-to-dismiss and TabView page swipe to coexist
  - **Validation flash**: `validationResult` set via `await MainActor.run` BEFORE async key derivation. During async gap, UI renders feedback because `validationResult` set and `step == .createNew` still true. Fix: only set `validationResult` when pattern is invalid; when valid, skip feedback and go straight to `.confirmNew`
  - **Dynamic Island stuck**: `Timer.scheduledTimer` runs on main RunLoop in `.default` mode. When app backgrounds, RunLoop stops firing `.default` timers. Fix: replace with `Task { while !Task.isCancelled { tick(); try? await Task.sleep(for: .milliseconds(500)) } }` — Task.sleep works in background with beginBackgroundTask
  - **Date grouping "Today/Earlier"**: Hardcoded 5-bucket system. Fix: `Calendar.startOfDay(for:)` for per-day grouping, "Today"/"Yesterday" for relative days, formatted date for older. ISO8601 date as unique group ID
  - **Keyboard sheet jump (RECURRING 3rd time)**: Sheets are independent view hierarchies — parent's `.ignoresSafeArea(.keyboard)` doesn't propagate. Fix: added modifier to RecoveryPhraseInputView, JoinVaultView, CustomRecoveryPhraseInputView
- **Tests added**: DateGroupingTests (14 tests — today/yesterday labels, per-day grouping, sort order, media/files split, nil dates, unique IDs), VaultFileItemTests (13 tests — isImage, isMedia, duration)
- **Key Learnings**:
  - `.gesture()` on a TabView blocks its internal page swipe — always use `.simultaneousGesture()` when combining gestures with TabView
  - `Timer.scheduledTimer` stops in background (RunLoop `.default` mode stops). `Task.sleep` continues with `beginBackgroundTask`. ActivityKit budget: ~2/sec (500ms) is reasonable, ~6/sec (170ms) is excessive
  - Async state update race: setting state in `await MainActor.run` before an async gap creates a window where UI briefly renders intermediate state. Fix: skip intermediate state when transitioning, only set it when staying on current step
  - `Calendar.startOfDay(for:)` + ISO8601 date as group ID is the clean pattern for day-based grouping — avoids title collisions across years
  - `LazyVStack` pinned section headers: use `Color.vaultBackground` (opaque) not `.ultraThinMaterial` (translucent) to prevent scroll content showing through

### Session 24 — Locked Screen Sheet Jump on Text Focus (Feb 14, 2026)
- **Query**: Locked vault background jumps when opening Join Shared Vault or Recovery and tapping text input
- **Approach**: Reviewed `PatternLockView`, `JoinVaultView`, and `RecoveryPhraseInputView`; found keyboard-safe-area modifiers present but sheet presentation still using default detents; pinned both lock-screen sheets to `.presentationDetents([.large])` to keep presentation height stable when keyboard appears
- **Files modified**: PatternLockView.swift (sheet detents + recovery accessibility IDs), `apps/ios/maestro/flows/core/locked_sheet_keyboard_stability.yaml` (new regression flow), apps/ios/AGENTS.md, .scratch-pad.md
- **Tests added**: `apps/ios/maestro/flows/core/locked_sheet_keyboard_stability.yaml` (covers Join Shared Vault and Recovery keyboard-focus stability on lock screen)
- **Errors**:
  - `xcodebuild` destination by simulator name failed due duplicate/case-variant device names. Re-ran build with explicit simulator UUID.
  - Maestro could not match `unlock_recovery_cancel`/`unlock_recovery_phrase_input` in Recovery sheet via id selectors; switched flow to visible text for cancel and coordinate tap for `TextEditor` focus.
- **Key Learnings**:
  - Keyboard-safe-area modifiers alone may not prevent visible lock-screen background movement if sheet detents are allowed to auto-shift on text focus
  - For lock-screen input sheets, set `.presentationDetents([.large])` where the sheet is presented
  - In Maestro, SwiftUI `TextEditor` fields in sheets may need `point` taps instead of id selectors for reliable focus/input.

### Session 25 — Vault Grid/Header Seam Removal (Feb 14, 2026)
- **Query**: Remove visible gap/seam between search controls and first date section header in vault grid
- **Approach**: Traced VaultView layout; identified `safeAreaInset(edge: .top)` default spacing as seam source; set top inset to `spacing: 0`; updated Maestro `vault_with_files` flow with search-field assertion for top-controls coverage
- **Files modified**: `apps/ios/Vault/Features/VaultViewer/VaultView.swift`, `apps/ios/maestro/flows/core/vault_with_files.yaml`, `apps/ios/AGENTS.md`, `.scratch-pad.md`
- **Validation**:
  - `xcodebuild` Debug simulator build succeeded
  - `maestro test apps/ios/maestro/flows/core/vault_with_files.yaml` passed
  - Captured simulator screenshot after fix confirmed seam removed (`outputs/vault_gap_check.png`)
- **Key Learnings**:
  - `safeAreaInset` default spacing is easy to miss and can manifest as thin visual gaps in pinned-header scroll layouts

### Session 26 — Change Pattern Error Replacement Fix (Feb 14, 2026)
- **Query**: On "Create New Pattern", one shown error stays stuck and newer errors don't replace it
- **Approach**: Traced `ChangePatternView` create-step state handling; found feedback precedence (`validationResult` shown before `errorMessage`) plus branches that didn't clear counterpart state. Added explicit state clearing in all branches and guarded against concurrent pattern-processing tasks.
- **Files modified**: `apps/ios/Vault/Features/Settings/VaultSettingsView.swift`, `apps/ios/maestro/flows/settings/change_pattern.yaml`, `apps/ios/AGENTS.md`, `.scratch-pad.md`
- **Validation**:
  - `xcodebuild` Debug simulator build succeeded
  - `maestro test apps/ios/maestro/flows/settings/change_pattern.yaml` passed (optional create-step assertion warned due swipe non-determinism)
- **Key Learnings**:
  - In SwiftUI, branch order in conditional UI (`if validationResult ... else if errorMessage ...`) makes state-cleanup mandatory when two feedback models coexist
  - Async pattern checks require `isProcessing` guard/disabled grid to avoid overlapping tasks that can race and overwrite feedback state

### Session 27 — Deterministic Maestro Hook for Change Pattern Error Replacement (Feb 14, 2026)
- **Query**: Add deterministic automated test for create-step error replacement behavior
- **Approach**: Added simulator-only test hooks in `ChangePatternView` (`change_pattern_test_skip_verify`, `change_pattern_test_set_validation_error`, `change_pattern_test_set_reused_error`) and a dedicated Maestro flow asserting stale validation errors are removed when reused-pattern error is shown.
- **Files modified**: `apps/ios/Vault/Features/Settings/VaultSettingsView.swift`, `apps/ios/maestro/flows/settings/change_pattern_error_replacement.yaml`, `apps/ios/maestro/flows/settings/change_pattern.yaml`, `apps/ios/AGENTS.md`, `.scratch-pad.md`
- **Validation**:
  - `xcodebuild` Debug simulator build succeeded
  - Installed fresh build via `simctl install` (critical)
  - `maestro test apps/ios/maestro/flows/settings/change_pattern_error_replacement.yaml` passed
  - `maestro test apps/ios/maestro/flows/settings/change_pattern.yaml` passed
- **Key Learnings**:
  - Simulator test hooks should be runtime-gated to non-production contexts and exposed via stable accessibility IDs
  - Maestro uses the installed app bundle; stale installs can make new test IDs appear "missing"

### Session 28 — Review Implementation Wave: Flow State, Streaming IO, Batch Sharing, Derived View Data (Feb 14, 2026)
- **Query**: Implement all approved review actions (`1a 2a 3a 4a`) across architecture, code quality, tests, and performance.
- **Approach**:
  - Extracted `ChangePatternFlowState` + `ChangePatternStep` and migrated `ChangePatternView` to explicit transition helpers.
  - Added unit coverage for flow-state precedence/reset/processing behavior.
  - Replaced import-time whole-file `Data(contentsOf:)` usage with URL-based storage and URL-based image thumbnail generation.
  - Added `FileHandle`-based streaming temp retrieval for VCSE path to avoid full encrypted-entry loads.
  - Batched consumed-state lookups in sharing sync/list paths.
  - Consolidated VaultView visible-data derivation into one pass and threaded into grid/viewer code paths.
  - Hardened Maestro settings flows with stronger deterministic assertions.
- **Files modified**: `VaultSettingsView.swift`, `PatternSetupCoordinatorTests.swift`, `FileUtilities.swift`, `VaultView+Actions.swift`, `CryptoEngine.swift`, `VaultStorage.swift`, `VaultStorageIntegrationTests.swift`, `CloudKitSharingManager.swift`, `ShareSyncManager.swift`, `ShareVaultView.swift`, `VaultView.swift`, `VaultView+Grid.swift`, `change_pattern.yaml`, `recovery_phrase.yaml`, `apps/ios/AGENTS.md`, `.scratch-pad.md`.
- **Validation**:
  - `build_sim` passed (Vault scheme, iOS simulator).
  - `test_sim` passed (192/192).
  - Targeted `ChangePatternFlowStateTests` passed (5/5).
  - Maestro flows passed: `settings/change_pattern.yaml`, `settings/change_pattern_error_replacement.yaml`, `settings/recovery_phrase.yaml`.
- **Key Learnings**:
  - Mutually exclusive UI feedback state (`validationResult` vs `errorMessage`) is safest when encoded via explicit transition APIs and unit tested.
  - Streaming decrypt pathways can silently regress to full-memory reads if retrieval APIs parse headers from in-memory blobs instead of `FileHandle` streams.
  - Sharing/status list surfaces should prefer batch fetch APIs over per-item lookups to avoid hidden N+1 latency.
  - Large SwiftUI bodies with repeated filters/maps should compute derived collections once per render pass and pass them down.

### Session 29 — Viewer Swipe Anchoring + Lock-Screen Modal Stability + Top Controls Breathing Room (Feb 14, 2026)
- **Query**: Fix remaining gallery swipe overflow between photos, lock-screen join/recovery keyboard jump artifacts, and add a little background/buffer below search controls.
- **Approach**:
  - Full-screen viewer: removed competing drag-to-dismiss gesture on the paged `TabView`, switched to deterministic indexed tags, and enforced full-frame clipped page layout.
  - Lock screen: made `PatternLockView` background explicitly opaque and moved Join/Recovery presentations to `.fullScreenCover` to isolate keyboard/input modals from underlying vault surfaces.
  - Vault top controls: added intentional bottom padding in `topSafeAreaContent` so pull-down states have breathing room under search/filter controls.
  - Maestro: hardened viewer swipe navigation flow to use deterministic grid tap coordinates and multiple swipe assertions.
- **Files modified**: `FullScreenPhotoViewer.swift`, `PatternLockView.swift`, `JoinVaultView.swift`, `VaultView+Toolbar.swift`, `photo_navigation.yaml`, `apps/ios/AGENTS.md`, `.scratch-pad.md`.
- **Validation**:
  - `build_sim` passed.
  - `test_sim` passed (192/192).
  - Maestro flows passed: `viewer/photo_navigation.yaml`, `core/locked_sheet_keyboard_stability.yaml`, `core/vault_with_files.yaml`.
- **Key Learnings**:
  - Page-style `TabView` stability is sensitive to competing gestures; if swipe anchoring regresses, remove or isolate extra drag gestures first.
  - For security-sensitive lock surfaces, transparency is risky even if logic is correct; opaque backgrounds prevent visual bleed-through during transitions.
  - Maestro `tapOn index` is brittle when screen chrome changes; coordinate or id-based selectors are more stable for viewer-entry flows.

### Session 30 — Native-Like Photo Paging Investigation + Stable Viewer Presentation (Feb 14, 2026)
- **Query**: Gallery photo viewer still overflows past image while swiping; investigate against native Photos behavior and ensure proper anchoring.
- **Approach**:
  - Traced viewer architecture and identified identity churn: `VaultView` used `fullScreenCover(item:)` with item id tied to the active photo index.
  - Replaced with stable boolean presentation (`fullScreenCover(isPresented:)`) and kept index as independent state, clamped on open.
  - Kept full-frame clipped page layout in `FullScreenPhotoViewer` and reran viewer + lock-sheet + top-controls regressions.
- **Files modified**: `VaultView.swift`, `apps/ios/AGENTS.md`, `.scratch-pad.md`.
- **Validation**:
  - `build_sim` passed.
  - `test_sim` passed (192/192).
  - Maestro flows passed: `viewer/photo_navigation.yaml`, `core/locked_sheet_keyboard_stability.yaml`, `core/vault_with_files.yaml`.
- **Key Learnings**:
  - Native-like paging requires stable presentation identity; swiping state should never drive modal identity.
  - `fullScreenCover(item:)` is safe for stable entities, not for rapidly changing indices.

### Session 31 — Native Photos-Style Pager Rewrite (Feb 14, 2026)
- **Query**: Viewer still reported as drifting past image boundaries after stable cover identity fix.
- **Approach**:
  - Replaced `TabView(.page)` with explicit horizontal pager using `ScrollView(.horizontal)` + `LazyHStack(spacing: 0)` + `.scrollTargetBehavior(.paging)` + `.scrollPosition(id:)`.
  - Synced pager id and `currentIndex` bidirectionally with guards to prevent feedback loops.
  - Kept page width fixed to viewport width and clipped each page to enforce hard per-page anchors.
- **Files modified**: `FullScreenPhotoViewer.swift`, `apps/ios/AGENTS.md`, `.scratch-pad.md`.
- **Validation**:
  - `build_sim` passed.
  - `test_sim` passed (192/192).
  - Maestro flows passed: `viewer/photo_navigation.yaml`, `core/locked_sheet_keyboard_stability.yaml`, `core/vault_with_files.yaml`.
- **Key Learnings**:
  - `ScrollView` paging APIs can be more deterministic than `TabView(.page)` when tight control over page anchors is required.
  - Maintaining a dedicated `pageScrollID` state lets the view absorb gesture updates without destabilizing modal presentation state.

### Session 32 — App Settings Appearance Mode (System / Light / Dark) (Feb 14, 2026)
- **Query**: Add an app settings option to switch between dark, light, and system mode.
- **Approach**:
  - Added `AppAppearanceMode` enum and persisted appearance state in `AppState` (`appAppearanceMode` key).
  - Applied appearance globally at app root via `.preferredColorScheme(appState.appearanceMode.preferredColorScheme)`.
  - Added segmented `Appearance` picker to `AppSettingsView` with explicit setter binding (`app_appearance_picker`).
  - Added/updated Maestro coverage for settings visibility and mode switching.
- **Files modified**: `VaultApp.swift`, `SettingsView.swift`, `app_settings.yaml`, `appearance_mode.yaml`, `apps/ios/AGENTS.md`, `.scratch-pad.md`.
- **Validation**:
  - `build_sim` passed.
  - `test_sim` passed (192/192).
  - Maestro flows passed: `settings/app_settings.yaml`, `settings/appearance_mode.yaml`, `settings/toggle_settings.yaml`, `viewer/photo_navigation.yaml`, `viewer/dismiss_with_swipe_down.yaml`.
- **Key Learnings**:
  - Appearance mode should be a single app-level source of truth; per-view color scheme overrides make behavior inconsistent.
  - Segmented picker with explicit `AppState` setter keeps persistence explicit and testable.

### Session 33 — Dark Mode Palette Readability Tuning (Feb 14, 2026)
- **Query**: Improve dark mode color readability while keeping light mode palette mostly unchanged.
- **Approach**:
  - Reviewed Figma’s color-combination guidance (harmony + contrast + dominant/support/accent role separation).
  - Tuned dark-only asset appearances for `VaultBackground`, `VaultSurface`, `VaultSecondaryText`, and `AccentColor`.
  - Kept all light-mode token values unchanged to preserve current look.
  - Updated theme documentation comments to reflect the new dark token intent.
- **Files modified**: `VaultBackground.colorset`, `VaultSurface.colorset`, `VaultSecondaryText.colorset`, `AccentColor.colorset`, `VaultTheme.swift`, `apps/ios/AGENTS.md`, `.scratch-pad.md`.
- **Validation**:
  - `build_sim` passed.
  - `test_sim` passed (192/192).
  - Maestro flows passed: `settings/appearance_mode.yaml`, `settings/app_settings.yaml`.
- **Key Learnings**:
  - Dark-mode legibility is most reliably improved by lifting base/surface luminance and secondary text opacity at token level, not by scattered per-view overrides.
  - A dark-specific accent variant can improve discoverability without disrupting light-mode brand color.

### Session 35 — 3 Bug Fixes: Import Memory Crash, File Sorting, Appearance Mode (Feb 15, 2026)
- **Query**: Fix 3 user-reported bugs: (1) newly added files sort under "December 31" until lock/unlock, (2) share extension import stuck with spinner, (3) system appearance mode still not working (4th attempt)
- **Root Causes**:
  - Sorting: `VaultFileItem` appended without `createdAt` → nil → `.distantPast` → "December 31". Fixed by adding `createdAt: Date()` to all 5 append sites in VaultView+Actions.
  - Import: `ImportIngestor.processBatch` loaded entire encrypted files into memory via `Data(contentsOf:)`, then decrypted to another in-memory copy. For 20 files with large videos, this caused OOM. Fixed with `CryptoEngine.decryptStagedFileToURL` that streams decryption via FileHandle (~256KB peak). Also added `StagedImportManager.encryptedFileURL` to get file URL without loading data.
  - Appearance: `.preferredColorScheme()` (SwiftUI) conflicted with `window.overrideUserInterfaceStyle` (UIKit). When switching from explicit (light/dark) back to nil (system), SwiftUI failed to revert. Fixed by removing ALL `.preferredColorScheme()` calls and relying solely on UIKit with `UIWindow.didBecomeKeyNotification` observer for new windows.
- **Also fixed**: Notification count mismatch (showed per-session count instead of total pending). Changed to use `StagedImportManager.pendingFileCount(for:)` for accurate total.
- **Tests**: 271 pass (3 new tests for `decryptStagedFileToURL`). Build 41 → TestFlight.
- **Key Learnings**:
  - `.preferredColorScheme(nil)` does NOT reliably revert to system after being set to `.light`/`.dark` — use UIKit `overrideUserInterfaceStyle = .unspecified` exclusively
  - `UIWindow.didBecomeKeyNotification` catches new windows from fullScreenCovers/sheets — better than per-view `.onAppear` calls
  - File-to-file decryption (`decryptStagedFileToURL`) with format auto-detection avoids O(2n) memory for each imported file

### Session 36 — 3 More Bug Fixes: Import Guard Race, Paywall Trial, Extension Sleep (Feb 15, 2026)
- **Query**: Fix 3 user-reported bugs: (1) import still not working (spinner forever), (2) paywall trial checkbox unchecks when switching plans, (3) phone sleeps during share extension encryption
- **Root Causes**:
  - Import: `PendingImportBanner` button set `isImporting = true` (bound to `$isImportingPendingFiles`) BEFORE calling `onImport()`. `importPendingFiles()` then hit `guard !isImportingPendingFiles else { return }` and bailed immediately. Spinner stayed forever because nothing reset the flag. Fix: removed premature `isImporting = true` from banner button.
  - Paywall: `planCard` onTapGesture set `trialEnabled = false` for non-annual plans but never reset to `true` when selecting annual again. Fix: `trialEnabled = type == .annual` (unconditional).
  - Extension sleep: Share extension had no idle timer management during encryption. Fix: KVC access to `UIApplication.shared` via `NSClassFromString`/`perform(selector)` since extensions can't use it directly at compile time.
- **Tests**: 271 pass. Build 42 → TestFlight.
- **Key Learnings**:
  - **@Binding + guard = classic race**: When a child view sets a @Binding flag and immediately calls a parent callback that guards on that same flag, the callback sees the updated state and bails. Always let the function that owns the guard be the one to set the flag.
  - **Extension UIApplication access**: `NSClassFromString("UIApplication")` + `perform(NSSelectorFromString("sharedApplication"))` + `setValue(_:forKey:)` works at runtime in app extensions even though compile-time API is restricted.
  - **Paywall state symmetry**: When toggling state based on selection (e.g., trial checkbox), always handle BOTH the enable and disable cases — don't rely on default state surviving navigation.

### Session 37 — Crash-Resilient Incremental Import (Feb 15, 2026)
- **Query**: App crashes partway through importing 32 files from share extension, then re-imports all 32 on restart creating duplicates. Add deduplication/progress tracking.
- **Root Causes**:
  - No incremental progress — batch import was all-or-nothing. Crash during file 15/32 meant all 32 would be retried.
  - No `autoreleasepool` per file — UIImage/CGImage/AVAsset temporaries accumulated across all files, causing OOM crash.
- **Fix**:
  - Delete `.enc` (and `.thumb.enc`) after each successful file import. On retry, missing `.enc` = already imported → skip.
  - Wrap each file's processing in `autoreleasepool` to release Foundation/UIKit temporaries between files.
  - Added `StagedImportManager.deleteEncryptedFile(batchId:fileId:)` and `encryptedThumbnailURL(batchId:fileId:)`.
  - Updated `ImportIngestorTests.testMissingEncryptedFileCountsAsFailed` → `testMissingEncryptedFileIsSkippedAsAlreadyImported`.
- **Tests**: 271 pass. Build 43 → TestFlight.
- **Key Learnings**:
  - **File-as-progress-marker pattern**: Instead of a separate progress DB, delete the input file after processing. Missing input = already done. Simple, crash-resilient, zero additional state.
  - **autoreleasepool in loops**: Any loop creating UIKit/Foundation temporaries (UIImage, CGImage, AVAsset) MUST wrap each iteration in `autoreleasepool` to prevent OOM in memory-constrained contexts.

### Session 38 — Streaming SVDF Build to Fix OOM During Vault Sharing (Feb 15, 2026)
- **Query**: Implement streaming SVDF construction to fix jetsam/OOM crash when sharing large vaults (96 files, 48.8MB video)
- **Root Cause**: `startBackgroundUpload` accumulated ALL re-encrypted `SharedFile` objects in a `sharedFiles` array (~vault_size), then `SVDFSerializer.buildFull` copied them all into a new `Data` blob (~vault_size again). Peak memory = 2x total vault size (~200MB for crashing vault).
- **Fix**:
  - Added `SVDFSerializer.buildFullStreaming(to:fileCount:forEachFile:metadata:shareKey:)` — writes SVDF entries to disk via FileHandle one at a time. Each SharedFile is encoded, written, then freed.
  - Replaced `sharedFiles` array accumulation in `BackgroundShareTransferManager.startBackgroundUpload` with streaming call. Closure decrypts + re-encrypts each file, caches it to ShareSyncCache, returns SharedFile which gets serialized to disk and released.
  - Eliminated post-upload per-file sync cache loop (now done during streaming).
  - SVDF streamed directly to `Self.svdfURL` (pending upload location) — avoids redundant copy.
- **Memory profile**: Peak drops from O(2 * vault_size) to O(vault_size) — the remaining peak is reading SVDF back for CloudKit upload.
- **Tests**: Build clean, zero warnings.
- **Key Learnings**:
  - FileHandle streaming with `handle.write()` + `handle.offsetInFile` + `handle.seek(toFileOffset:)` is an effective pattern for building large binary files without memory spikes.
  - Synchronous closure `(Int) throws -> T` inside a Task.detached inherits the task context — `Task.checkCancellation()` works correctly for cooperative cancellation.
  - Per-file progress (1-5% range) is negligible — acceptable to batch-update after streaming completes.

### Session 39 — Further Memory Optimization + Deploy Build 47 (Feb 15, 2026)
- **Query**: Continue from session 38 — build 45 still crashed, apply deeper memory optimization
- **Root Cause**: `encodeFileEntry` copies `file.encryptedContent` into an intermediate `Data` buffer (`entry.append(file.encryptedContent)`) — doubling peak memory for large files (~49MB video). Also, decrypted content and encrypted content coexist in memory longer than necessary.
- **Fix**:
  - Added `writeFileEntryStreaming(_:to:)` — writes file header fields to a small Data buffer, then writes `file.encryptedContent` directly to FileHandle (no copy).
  - Updated `buildFullStreaming` to use `writeFileEntryStreaming` instead of `encodeFileEntry`.
  - Tightened content scope in `BackgroundShareTransferManager.forEachFile` closure — wrapped decrypted `content` in a `do {}` block so it's freed immediately after encryption, before thumbnail/cache work.
- **Embrace migration collision**: Working directory had uncommitted Embrace SDK migration changes (beads #111-#114) mixed with streaming changes. Build failed on EmbraceManager.swift errors. Fixed by: stashing Embrace files (which didn't properly revert working tree), then manually replacing all `EmbraceManager` → `SentryManager` in 16+ files.
- **Memory profile**: Peak drops from O(vault_size) to O(largest_file * 2) — only one file's decrypted + encrypted data in memory at a time.
- **Deploy**: Build 47 → TestFlight (internal groups auto-receive). Builds 46 was already on ASC from unknown source.
- **Key Learnings**:
  - `git stash push -- file1 file2` saves diffs but may NOT revert the working tree — always verify with `git diff` after stash.
  - `encodeFileEntry` with `entry.append(largeData)` creates a second copy — for large files, write header and content separately to FileHandle.
  - `do {}` blocks in Swift create a scope that forces early deallocation of `let` bindings — useful for releasing large Data before the enclosing function scope ends.
  - When mixing multiple feature branches in working directory, isolate changes by stashing/reverting unrelated work before building.

### Session 40 — Onboarding Analytics Crash Fix + TestFlight Build 49 (Feb 15, 2026)
- **Query**: App crashes on clean install during onboarding when tapping "Enable Analytics".
- **Root Cause**: `EmbraceManager.start()` called `Embrace.setup(...).start()` inside `Task.detached`. Embrace `HangCaptureService` enforces queue affinity and hit `dispatch_assert_queue` (`EXC_BREAKPOINT`) when initialized off main queue.
- **Fix**:
  - Updated `EmbraceManager.start()` to execute setup/start directly on `@MainActor` (removed `Task.detached` wrapper).
  - Added failure rollback (`isStarted = false`, `hasSetup = false`) so failed setup can retry safely.
- **Validation**:
  - `xcodebuild test` passed: 271/271.
  - Reproduced failing Maestro flow (`analytics_enable_crash_check`) before fix and confirmed pass after fix.
  - Uploaded build 49 to TestFlight and confirmed `processingState: VALID`; assigned to beta group `Internal Testers`.
- **Key Learnings**:
  - Embrace startup APIs are thread-sensitive; treat setup/start as main-queue-only initialization.
  - Crash reports with `dispatch_assert_queue` + `HangCaptureService` are a direct signal of incorrect Embrace initialization threading.

### Session 34 — TestFlight Build 35 Upload (Feb 14, 2026)
- **Query**: Send latest app update to TestFlight.
- **Approach**:
  - Bumped `CURRENT_PROJECT_VERSION` from 34 to 35.
  - Ran archive/export flow via `publish-testflight.sh`; archive succeeded but export failed with `Failed to Use Accounts`.
  - Retried `xcodebuild -exportArchive` with ASC API key flags and upload succeeded.
  - Polled ASC until build `35` appeared and confirmed `processingState: VALID`.
- **Files modified**: `Vault.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj`, `apps/ios/AGENTS.md`, `.scratch-pad.md`.
- **Validation**:
  - Archive succeeded.
  - Upload succeeded.
  - ASC build detected: `14d8bf10-79ce-4b91-b5f4-f07db1c0c556` (`version: 35`, `processingState: VALID`).
- **Key Learnings**:
  - `xcodebuild` export/upload can fail without an active Xcode account session even when archive is valid; ASC API key flags make the flow deterministic in CI/headless environments.

### Session 41 — Share Encryption OOM Hardening + SVDF Bounds Safety (Feb 15, 2026)
- **Query**: App crashes around 1-2% during "Encrypting files..." when sharing vaults containing particular large files.
- **Root Cause**:
  - Share packaging path loaded whole decrypted file `Data` (`retrieveFileContent`) and then whole re-encrypted `Data` (`CryptoEngine.encrypt`) before writing to SVDF.
  - Peak memory scaled with `decrypted + encrypted` for the largest file; abrupt process termination matched jetsam/OOM behavior (no app exception stack in console snippet).
  - SVDF serializer had unchecked `UInt16`/`UInt32` casts for lengths/sizes that could trap on out-of-range values.
- **Fix**:
  - Added `SVDFSerializer.buildFullStreamingFromPlaintext(...)` + `StreamingSourceFile` and `writeFileEntryStreamingFromPlaintext(...)` to stream-encrypt plaintext temp files directly into SVDF output `FileHandle`.
  - Refactored `BackgroundShareTransferManager.startBackgroundUpload` to use `retrieveFileToTempURL(...)` + plaintext streaming serializer path; removed full-file in-memory re-encryption during initial share upload.
  - Added deterministic temp-file cleanup after each streamed entry.
  - Added numeric bounds validation helpers (`checkedUInt16`/`checkedUInt32`) in `SVDFSerializer` and converted unsafe casts to throwing errors.
  - Added oversized-file guard in incremental sync (`ShareSyncManager`) to skip uncached files >256MB rather than risk jetsam in in-memory re-encrypt path.
- **Validation**:
  - `xcodebuild test` via MCP passed: 274/274.
  - Share setup Maestro flow executed without regression in simulator (iCloud controls unavailable in sim as expected).
- **Key Learnings**:
  - OOM/jetsam terminations often invalidate scene/process without a Swift exception frame; treat "app vanished" logs during heavy crypto as memory-pressure suspects first.
  - Crash SDKs may miss `SIGKILL`/jetsam paths; add staged breadcrumbs and durable progress checkpoints around long-running crypto/upload phases.

### Session 42 — TestFlight Build 50 Push (Feb 16, 2026)
- **Query**: Push latest fixes to TestFlight.
- **Approach**:
  - Bumped `CURRENT_PROJECT_VERSION` from 47 → 50.
  - Archived + exported/uploaded with ASC API key flags to avoid account-session dependency.
  - Verified build `50` in ASC with `processingState: VALID`.
  - Added build to TestFlight group `Internal Testers` (group is external despite name).
- **Key Learnings**:
  - `asc builds list` (v0.28.7) has no `--version` filter; use JSON + `jq` on `.attributes.version`.
  - Group names are not authoritative for internal/external behavior; always verify `Internal` flag before deciding whether `add-groups` is needed.

### Session 43 — Dynamic Island Pixel Loader Speed Alignment (Feb 16, 2026)
- **Query**: Dynamic Island pixel loader looked too slow vs other pixel loaders.
- **Root Cause**: `BackgroundShareTransferManager` advanced `animationStep` every 500ms, while in-app `PixelAnimation.loading()` runs at 100ms cadence.
- **Fix**:
  - Set Live Activity animation tick to 100ms in `BackgroundShareTransferManager`.
  - Kept progress interpolation visually stable by increasing smoothing window from 5 ticks to 25 ticks.
  - Updated `TransferActivityAttributes` comment to reflect 0.1s tick cadence.
- **Validation**: Full iOS simulator tests passed (274/274).
- **Key Learnings**:
  - Dynamic Island `LivePixelGrid` speed is driven by host app `ContentState` update cadence, not by the widget itself.
  - If `animationStep` and in-app loader timer intervals diverge, users perceive inconsistent loader speed even when pattern/brightness are identical.

### Session 44 — Resume Upload Crash on Reopening Share Screen (Feb 16, 2026)
- **Query**: If upload is in progress, app is backgrounded, then reopened and Share Vault screen is opened, app crashes instead of resuming upload.
- **Root Cause**:
  - `BackgroundShareTransferManager.hasPendingUpload` called `loadPendingUpload()`, which eagerly read full `pending_upload/svdf_data.bin` into `Data` on the main thread.
  - For large pending uploads, simply rendering the share status banner could trigger a large memory spike and termination.
  - Resume path also rebuilt full in-memory chunk arrays from SVDF bytes before upload.
- **Fix**:
  - Replaced pending-load check with metadata-only `loadPendingUploadState()` (TTL + state decode + file existence), no blob read.
  - Added `CloudKitSharingManager.uploadChunksFromFile(...)` to stream missing chunks directly from disk by index.
  - Refactored `resumePendingUpload(...)` to upload from file URL and initialize `ShareSyncCache` via file copy + streamed chunk hashing.
  - Added `ShareSyncCache.saveSVDF(from:)` and `computeChunkHashes(from:)` for no-full-buffer resume finalization.
- **Validation**: Full iOS simulator tests passed (274/274).
- **Key Learnings**:
  - Never gate UI visibility checks on loading large payload blobs; resumability checks must be metadata-only.
  - Resume/retry paths need the same memory discipline as first-run paths, especially before upload starts.

### Session 45 — TestFlight Build 51 Release (Feb 16, 2026)
- **Query**: Push latest resume-upload crash fix to TestFlight.
- **Approach**:
  - Bumped iOS build number from 50 → 51 in `project.pbxproj`.
  - Archived (`Release`, generic iOS) and exported/uploaded with ASC API-key auth.
  - Verified build `51` reached `VALID` in ASC, then added it to group `Internal Testers`.
- **Validation**:
  - Archive succeeded (`** ARCHIVE SUCCEEDED **`).
  - Export/upload succeeded (`** EXPORT SUCCEEDED **`).
  - ASC build state: `VALID` at `2026-02-16T04:10:45-08:00`.
- **Key Learnings**:
  - Current `asc` CLI expects `--output json`; `--json` is not a valid flag.
  - `asc builds add-groups` works after build reaches `VALID` for external-style groups like `Internal Testers`.

### Session 46 — Dynamic Island Loader Freeze Between Progress Updates (Feb 16, 2026)
- **Query**: Dynamic Island pixel loader froze and only moved when upload percentage changed.
- **Root Cause**:
  - Loader rendering depended on `context.state.animationStep` updates from ActivityKit `ContentState`.
  - During uploads, ActivityKit can coalesce/throttle state updates, so animation frames stop between progress changes.
- **Fix**:
  - Added widget-side `TimelineView(.animation(minimumInterval: 0.1))` around `LivePixelGrid` in `TransferLiveActivityWidget`.
  - Kept `animationStep` as a base offset; timeline now advances frames continuously even when state updates are sparse.
  - Updated `LivePixelGrid` comments to reflect timeline-driven animation support.
- **Validation**: Full iOS simulator tests passed (274/274).
- **Key Learnings**:
  - Live Activity visuals should not rely exclusively on high-frequency `Activity.update` calls for animation smoothness.
  - For Dynamic Island loaders, use timeline-driven local animation and use state updates for semantic progress/status.

### Session 47 — TestFlight Build 52 Push (Feb 16, 2026)
- **Query**: Push current main branch to TestFlight.
- **Approach**:
  - Bumped iOS build number from 51 → 52 in `Vault.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj`.
  - Ran `scripts/publish-testflight.sh`; archive succeeded, export failed with `Failed to Use Accounts`.
  - Retried `xcodebuild -exportArchive` with ASC API key flags; upload succeeded.
  - Polled ASC until build `52` appeared and confirmed `processingState: VALID`.
  - Added build `9fe1a658-3e79-4cc4-a225-e616da9f9acd` to beta group `Internal Testers`.
- **Validation**:
  - Archive succeeded (`** ARCHIVE SUCCEEDED **`).
  - Export/upload succeeded on API-key retry (`** EXPORT SUCCEEDED **`).
  - ASC build state: `VALID` at `2026-02-16T04:39:08-08:00`.
- **Key Learnings**:
  - `asc builds latest --version` can temporarily miss a just-uploaded build; poll `asc builds list --sort -uploadedDate` instead.
  - Keep TestFlight completion criteria strict: build is visible in ASC, `processingState = VALID`, and target beta group assignment succeeds.

### Session 48 — Long-Running Upload Resilience + Auto Resume (Feb 16, 2026)
- **Query**: Ensure vault upload survives backgrounding longer than ~30s, keep Dynamic Island progress updates while running, and auto-resume interrupted uploads when vault is opened.
- **Approach**:
  - Added `BGTaskScheduler` integration (`app.vaultaire.ios.share-upload.resume`) in `BackgroundShareTransferManager` for deferred resume opportunities.
  - Added scheduling/cancellation/completion lifecycle for BG tasks and wired task expiration cancellation.
  - Added `resumePendingUploadIfNeeded(trigger:)` and a vault-key provider to auto-resume whenever key is available.
  - Hooked auto-resume into app lifecycle (`didBecomeActive`, `scenePhase == .active`) and vault lifecycle (`unlockWithPattern`, `VaultView` task/key-change).
  - Added Info.plist permissions for BG processing (`BGTaskSchedulerPermittedIdentifiers`, `UIBackgroundModes: processing`).
- **Validation**:
  - iOS simulator build passed for scheme `Vault`.
  - iOS simulator tests passed: 274/274.
- **Key Learnings**:
  - `BGProcessingTask` complements but does not replace immediate `beginBackgroundTask`; both are needed for robust continuation.
  - Auto-resume should be key-driven (when vault key is present), not screen-driven.

### Session 49 — TestFlight Build 53 Push (Feb 16, 2026)
- **Query**: Push latest main branch to TestFlight.
- **Approach**:
  - Bumped iOS build number from 52 → 53 in `Vault.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj`.
  - Ran `scripts/publish-testflight.sh`; archive succeeded, export failed with `Failed to Use Accounts`.
  - Retried export/upload with ASC API key flags and upload succeeded.
  - Polled ASC until build `53` appeared and confirmed `processingState: VALID`.
  - Added build `8cb92894-cec2-437d-9744-9a10d79ea19a` to beta group `Internal Testers`.
- **Validation**:
  - Archive succeeded (`** ARCHIVE SUCCEEDED **`).
  - Export/upload succeeded on API-key retry (`** EXPORT SUCCEEDED **`).
  - ASC build state: `VALID` at `2026-02-16T05:07:28-08:00`.
- **Key Learnings**:
  - ASC indexing delay can exceed two minutes; continue polling before declaring failure.
  - Build rows may appear already `VALID`, so gate on ASC state rather than upload timestamps.

### Session 50 — Share Extension Crash Near End of 37-file Batch (Feb 16, 2026)
- **Query**: Share extension crashes while adding many files (video evidence showed termination around "Encrypting 36 of 37 files"), then return to system share sheet.
- **Root Cause**:
  - Heavy per-file encryption/thumbnail work was running in `ShareViewController` main-actor execution path.
  - Extension kept full attachment provider references for the whole batch, increasing memory pressure.
  - Manifest was only written at the very end, so abrupt termination risked losing all staged progress.
- **Fix**:
  - Moved heavy per-file sync crypto/thumbnail work into non-main execution (`Task.detached`) in `ShareAttachmentProcessor`.
  - Replaced full attachment array retention with count-first + streaming provider iteration.
  - Added manifest checkpoint writes after each successfully staged file.
  - Added targeted per-file staging logs and made staged models `Sendable` for cleaner concurrency boundaries.
  - Cleaned test warnings (`@discardableResult` helper, removed unused var) to keep warning-clean validation.
- **Validation**:
  - iOS simulator build succeeded.
  - iOS simulator tests passed: 274/274.
- **Key Learnings**:
  - Share extension watchdog terminations can look like "silent return to share sheet" rather than explicit app errors.
  - Batch checkpointing turns abrupt extension termination into resumable staged progress instead of total loss.

### Session 51 — TestFlight Build 54 Push for Share-Extension Hardening (Feb 16, 2026)
- **Query**: Build, validate, and ship the share-extension crash hardening fix to TestFlight.
- **Approach**:
  - Ran simulator build/tests after implementation and removed remaining test warnings caused by unused test values.
  - Bumped iOS build number from 53 → 54.
  - Archived via publish script; export failed with `Failed to Use Accounts`.
  - Retried export/upload with ASC API key flags; upload succeeded.
  - Polled ASC until build `54` appeared `VALID`, then assigned group `Internal Testers`.
- **Validation**:
  - Simulator build succeeded.
  - Simulator tests passed: 274/274.
  - ASC build: `99a1c250-e3fb-4e97-bb55-8b5fa21202b2`, version `54`, `VALID`.
- **Key Learnings**:
  - Share-extension reliability fixes should ship with explicit regression evidence (full tests + warning cleanup), not only local repro confidence.
  - ASC indexing still requires polling patience even after immediate upload success.

### Session 52 — Dynamic Island Pixel Loader Re-alignment (Feb 16, 2026)
- **Query**: User reported Dynamic Island pixel loader visual drift; requirement is all pixel loaders must stay consistent across app and Dynamic Island.
- **Root Cause**:
  - Widget animation combined app-side `animationStep` and timeline ticks (`baseStep + timelineStep`), altering perceived loader cadence.
  - Trail opacity in `LivePixelGrid` had become longer than in-app fade overlap.
- **Fix**:
  - Switched widget loader to a single 0.1s timeline-driven step source.
  - Re-tuned `LivePixelGrid` trail opacity to head + 2 trailing cells to match in-app visual persistence.
- **Validation**:
  - iOS simulator build succeeded.
  - iOS simulator tests passed: 274/274.
- **Key Learnings**:
  - For cross-surface animation parity, cadence source matters as much as pattern/brightness.
  - Loader parity regressions are best fixed by simplifying the step pipeline, not layering additional offsets.

### Session 53 — Onboarding Completion Uses Unlock Ceremony (Feb 16, 2026)
- **Query**: At the end of onboarding, transition from recovery phrase to vault jumped with no animation; match the locked-state unlock animation.
- **Root Cause**:
  - `PatternSetupView` set `appState.isUnlocked = true` during pattern save, while onboarding UI was still visible.
  - `ContentView` unlock transition is keyed off `isUnlocked`, so the animation fired off-screen and was gone by the time onboarding dismissed.
- **Fix**:
  - Removed early `isUnlocked` mutation from `PatternSetupView`.
  - Converted `AppState.completeOnboarding()` to async ceremony: set onboarding complete, show `isLoading`, wait 1.5s, then set `isUnlocked`.
  - Reused one `unlockCeremonyDelayNanoseconds` constant for both onboarding completion and standard unlock path.
  - Updated `OnboardingView` to call the async completion path and updated onboarding Maestro flow to assert the `Unlocking...` transition.
- **Validation**:
  - iOS simulator build succeeded.
  - iOS simulator tests passed: 274/274.
- **Key Learnings**:
  - Root-view transition triggers must be tied to the moment the destination route is actually visible.
  - Centralizing unlock ceremony timing avoids drift between onboarding and lock-screen unlock UX.

### Session 54 — Multi-Upload Share Redesign + Aggregate Dynamic Island (Feb 16, 2026)
- **Query**: Redesign sharing so uploads are not singular: support concurrent uploads (same vault and across vaults), row-level status/terminate controls, aggregate Dynamic Island updates, robust background continuation/resume, and prevent sleep while on share screen during uploads.
- **Root Cause**:
  - Existing upload path (`BackgroundShareTransferManager`) was single-task/single-pending-state (`Documents/pending_upload/state.json` + one Live Activity), and UI assumed one in-flight upload banner.
  - Share management and upload progress were split across incompatible view modes, blocking multi-upload visibility/control.
- **Fix**:
  - Added `ShareUploadManager` to orchestrate multi-upload jobs with per-job state, per-job persistence in `Documents/pending_uploads/<jobId>/`, per-job cancel/resume, and owner-fingerprint filtering for cross-vault isolation.
  - Switched upload lifecycle hooks in app state/lifecycle (`onAppear`, `didBecomeActive`, `scenePhase`, unlock paths, app launch BG-task registration) to `ShareUploadManager`.
  - Redesigned `ShareVaultView` to show upload jobs as share-style cards with status badges and row actions (`Resume`, `Terminate`, `Show Phrase`), replacing singular upload banner flow.
  - Added share-screen idle-timer policy: disable auto-lock while share screen is visible and any upload job is running.
  - Extended `TransferActivityAttributes.ContentState` with `activeUploadCount` and updated `TransferLiveActivityWidget` to present aggregate multi-upload context in Dynamic Island/lock-screen views.
  - Updated `maestro/flows/sharing/share_vault_setup.yaml` to assert the new optional phrase-sheet/upload-row UI elements.
- **Validation**:
  - iOS simulator build succeeded.
  - iOS simulator tests passed: 274/274.
  - Maestro sharing flow executed successfully (optional assertions warned in simulator due iCloud/state variance).
- **Key Learnings**:
  - Multi-upload reliability requires per-job persisted state; a single global pending blob cannot represent parallel uploads safely.
  - Aggregate Live Activity payloads need explicit concurrency metadata (`activeUploadCount`) to communicate parallel work without multiple competing activities.
  - Share-screen sleep prevention should be scoped to screen visibility + active upload rows to avoid unintended global idle-timer side effects.

### Session 55 — Staged Import UX Parity with In-Vault Import Progress (Feb 16, 2026)
- **Query**: Replace staged-import banner spinner with the same progress experience used for direct file imports inside the vault.
- **Root Cause**:
  - `ImportIngestor` exposed only final aggregate results and no incremental progress callback.
  - Pending counts used manifest totals, which can include files already imported in prior attempts (missing `.enc`), causing inaccurate progress expectations.
- **Fix**:
  - Added `ImportIngestor.ImportProgress` and progress callback support to `processPendingImports`.
  - Added `StagedImportManager.pendingImportableFileCount` / `importableFileCount` to count only files with present `.enc` payloads.
  - Updated `VaultView.importPendingFiles()` to drive existing `importProgress` overlay (`localImportProgressContent`) from staged-ingest progress updates, including initial `(0, total)` state.
  - Kept cleanup deterministic on completion/cancel (`isImportingPendingFiles`, idle timer, `importProgress`) and refreshed pending-import banner counts from remaining importable files.
  - Added unit tests for importable-count semantics and progress callback behavior.
- **Validation**:
  - iOS simulator build succeeded.
  - iOS simulator tests passed: 277/277.
- **Key Learnings**:
  - Staged imports should share the exact same progress state pipeline as direct imports to avoid UX divergence.
  - Counting importable payloads (not manifest entries) prevents stale progress totals during retries/partial completion.

### Session 56 — Share Screen Mode Stability During Concurrent Uploads (Feb 16, 2026)
- **Query**: Share screen resets back to manage view when user taps "Share with someone new" during an active upload.
- **Root Cause**:
  - `ShareVaultView` refreshes upload jobs every second and recomputed mode each tick.
  - Mode recomputation always preferred `.manageShares` when any upload/share existed, overriding manual transition to `.newShare`.
- **Fix**:
  - Extracted mode resolution into `ShareVaultView.resolveMode(currentMode:hasShareData:)`.
  - Made `.newShare` sticky so background refresh no longer forces a snap-back.
  - Kept auto-transitions for `.loading` and `.manageShares` when share data appears/disappears.
  - Added `share_new_share` accessibility ID and Maestro flow assertion for this regression path.
  - Added `ShareVaultViewModeTests` unit tests covering mode transitions and state preservation.
- **Validation**:
  - iOS simulator build succeeded.
  - iOS simulator tests passed: 283/283.
  - Maestro flow execution was attempted but no device was attached in this environment (`0 devices connected`).
- **Key Learnings**:
  - Background-refresh state should never override explicit user navigation intent.
  - A pure mode resolver with unit tests prevents future regressions in view-state orchestration.

### Session 57 — Share Upload Row Terminate Hard-Stop Semantics (Feb 16, 2026)
- **Query**: Tapping terminate on a share upload row should immediately reset the screen and clean up, like "Stop All Sharing", without lingering failed-row errors.
- **Root Cause**:
  - Row terminate used `cancelUpload`, which retained a `.cancelled` job in memory/UI.
  - In-flight async work could still surface failure state after payload deletion (`svdf_data.bin` missing), creating a delayed error row.
- **Fix**:
  - Added `ShareUploadManager.terminateUpload(jobId:vaultKey:cleanupRemote:)` for hard termination.
  - Hard termination now cancels task, clears pending upload files, removes the job from manager state immediately, removes local share record when present, and runs CloudKit + cache cleanup in background.
  - Added termination guard state (`terminatedJobIds`) so cancellation/error handlers skip failure transitions and notifications for user-terminated jobs.
  - Updated row terminate action and stop-all-sharing job loop to use hard termination.
- **Validation**:
  - iOS simulator build succeeded.
  - iOS simulator tests passed: 283/283.
- **Key Learnings**:
  - User-initiated terminate should be treated as destructive completion, not a status transition.
  - Suppressing late async failure handling after explicit terminate prevents confusing "failed after terminate" UX.

### Session 58 — Share Vault Tap Freeze from Main-Actor Packaging (Feb 16, 2026)
- **Query**: Tapping "Share Vault" freezes the entire share screen for multiple seconds every time.
- **Root Cause**:
  - `ShareUploadManager` is `@MainActor`, and `runInitialUpload`/`runResumeUpload` were executing expensive synchronous work on main actor: vault index/decrypt traversal, SVDF streaming build loops, and sync-cache hash writes.
  - This blocked UI rendering/interaction immediately after tapping share.
- **Fix**:
  - Added detached off-main preparation pipeline (`buildInitialUploadArtifacts`) and cancellation bridging.
  - Moved initial SVDF packaging/decrypt-encrypt loops out of main actor.
  - Moved sync-cache persistence/hash computation in both initial and resume paths to detached utility tasks.
  - Kept only status/progress/job bookkeeping on main actor.
- **Validation**:
  - iOS simulator build succeeded.
  - iOS simulator tests passed: 283/283.
- **Key Learnings**:
  - `@MainActor` singletons are orchestration layers, not execution contexts for crypto/file pipelines.
  - Any share-start path must keep tap-to-feedback latency near-instant by offloading packaging work immediately.

### Session 59 — Share Screen Final-State Transition After Upload Completion (Feb 16, 2026)
- **Query**: After share upload completes, share screen should transition to final shared-state summary instead of continuing to show a completed upload row.
- **Root Cause**:
  - Upload list rendered all jobs from manager state, including terminal `.complete` and `.cancelled`.
  - The screen stayed visually in "uploading just finished" mode instead of showing only active shares summary.
- **Fix**:
  - Filtered upload rows in `ShareVaultView.refreshUploadJobs` using `shouldDisplayUploadJob` to hide terminal jobs.
  - Refreshed active share records during upload-job refresh so the view converges to active-shares summary quickly.
  - Added unit tests in `ShareVaultViewModeTests` validating terminal-job filtering behavior.
- **Validation**:
  - iOS simulator build succeeded.
  - iOS simulator tests passed: 285/285.
- **Key Learnings**:
  - Completion UX should pivot from progress reporting to resulting state summary.
  - Explicit terminal-status filtering in UI avoids coupling display semantics to long-lived manager history.

### Session 60 — Clear Completed Upload Jobs from Manager Queue (Feb 16, 2026)
- **Query**: Upload state still shows completed rows despite no running uploads.
- **Root Cause**:
  - `ShareUploadManager` retained `.complete` jobs in `jobsById` after successful upload.
  - UI-level filtering can be bypassed by refresh/order edge cases and leaves stale queue semantics.
- **Fix**:
  - Replaced final success state mutation with `removeJob(jobId:)` in both initial and resume completion paths.
  - Kept success notification and active share record persistence unchanged.
- **Validation**:
  - iOS simulator build succeeded.
  - iOS simulator tests passed: 285/285.
- **Key Learnings**:
  - Success completion should drain queue state, not accumulate terminal entries.
  - Share list (`activeShares`) is the correct final-state representation after upload completion.

---

## Cumulative Learnings

- **Session count**: 40
- **Build success rate**: 38/39
- **Key pattern**: Sequential workstream implementation with build gates works well for large multi-file UX changes
- **Architecture insight**: This codebase uses a 3-tier file model (VaultFileItem → LightweightFileEntry → VaultFileEntry) — changes to file metadata must propagate through all three
- **Sharing architecture**: BackgroundShareTransferManager (@MainActor, @Observable) → Task.detached for crypto work → CloudKitSharingManager for CloudKit ops. All crypto keys captured by value to survive vault lock.
- **Incremental sync**: SVDF v4 is append-stable (existing bytes never move). ShareSyncCache stores per-share encrypted files + SVDF blob + chunk hashes. Sync flow: diff file IDs → re-encrypt only new files (check cache first) → build SVDF incrementally → hash chunks → upload only changed chunks.
- **CloudKit idempotency**: ALWAYS fetch before save for deterministic record IDs. Never trust local cache to know whether a CloudKit record exists — the initial upload path, partial failures, and retries can all leave records that the cache doesn't know about. Use `fetchOrCreateRecord()` pattern everywhere.
- **Parallel CloudKit uploads**: `withThrowingTaskGroup` with bounded concurrency (4) handles rate limiting gracefully — `saveWithRetry` inside each task catches transient CKErrors. If one chunk fails hard, the group cancels remaining tasks via cooperative cancellation.
- **Code review workflow**: Architecture → Code Quality → Tests → Performance, max 4 issues per section, user approves before implementation. Works well for thorough reviews without scope creep.
- **Test infrastructure**: VaultTests target uses `@testable import Vault` with `TEST_HOST` pattern — no need to share source files between targets. TS prefix IDs for all pbxproj entries. 32 tests across 4 suites covering CryptoEngine, SVDFSerializer, ShareSyncCache, and SharedVaultData.
- **Resumable uploads**: Persist SVDF + metadata to `Documents/pending_upload/` before CloudKit upload. On resume, `existingChunkIndices()` queries CloudKit with cursor pagination, filters to missing chunks only, uploads them with parallel concurrency. 24h TTL auto-discards stale state. Duplicate share record guard prevents double-append to vault index.
- **Maestro E2E testing**: `#if DEBUG` test mode bypass with `-MAESTRO_TEST` launch arg provides deterministic key + auto-unlock + lock trigger bypass. 60+ accessibilityIdentifiers across all views enable Maestro element targeting. 30 YAML flows cover onboarding, core, camera, viewer, search, edit mode, settings, sharing, and premium features. 29/30 pass (96.7%) — only `import_from_library` fails due to system photo picker limitation. `-MAESTRO_SEED_FILES` flag pre-populates vault with test images for flows needing files.
- **Monorepo structure**: iOS at `apps/ios/`, web at `web/`, shared docs at `docs/`, design at `design/`. Root AGENTS.md has monorepo concerns (beads, git, sessions). Subproject AGENTS.md files have project-specific knowledge. Xcode relative refs survive moves as long as .xcodeproj and sibling dirs move together.
- **Link-based sharing**: ShareLinkEncoder uses version-byte prefix (0x01=raw, 0x02=deflate) + base58 encoding of phrases into URL fragments. DeepLinkHandler is `@Observable` and presented via `fullScreenCover` from ContentView regardless of lock state (safe since no vault data is exposed). SL prefix IDs in pbxproj. Requires AASA file + landing page on vaultaire.app for universal links to work (out of scope for iOS-only implementation).
- **VaultIndex creation**: NEVER use bare v1 init for new vaults — `loadIndex(with:)` auto-creates proper v3 with master key, blob descriptor, and correct version. Bare init creates a file that blocks auto-creation and has no master key, causing `storeFile` to throw.
- **Screen cloning discipline**: When replicating a flow (e.g., join vault pattern from onboarding), copy ALL behavior — validation, haptics, error messages, feedback UI, accessibility IDs. Partial clones create inconsistent UX and missing test coverage.
- **Pattern board normalization**: 3 categories — "create new" (full PatternValidator + feedback + strength), "confirm" (match error only), "enter existing" (minimal validation). All pattern screens documented in AGENTS.md with exact required behavior per category. NEVER modify one pattern screen without checking all others for consistency.
- **Mandatory Maestro rule**: Every visual/UI change requires corresponding Maestro test updates. Rule codified in `apps/ios/AGENTS.md` with checklist: new screens → new flows, new elements → accessibility IDs + assertions, changed text → updated assertions, changed navigation → updated flow sequences.
- **TestFlight pipeline**: Manual signing for Release configs (distribution cert + App Store profiles), automatic for Debug. ExportOptions.plist with `app-store-connect` + `destination: upload` for direct ASC upload. Sentry script phase must be AFTER Embed Foundation Extensions. Build script at `scripts/publish-testflight.sh`. First build: v1.0(1), ASC app ID `6758529311`, group "Internal Testers".
- **ASC post-upload visibility**: Fresh uploads may not be queryable by version immediately. For deterministic verification, poll `asc builds list --sort -uploadedDate --limit 20`, then gate completion on `processingState: VALID`.
- **Three-layer upload resilience**: Best reliability comes from combining immediate background time (`beginBackgroundTask`), scheduled recovery (`BGProcessingTask`), and persisted pending-upload metadata resumed on next unlock.
- **ASC verification discipline**: For deterministic TestFlight completion, always include: upload success, ASC row visibility, `processingState: VALID`, and beta-group assignment success.
- **Share extension large-batch hardening**: Keep encryption off main actor, avoid provider retention across full batches, and checkpoint `manifest.json` incrementally.
- **Release packaging discipline**: For crash-fix releases, pair functional fix commits with a dedicated build-number/TestFlight commit and confirm group assignment in ASC before handoff.
- **Pixel loader parity discipline**: Keep Dynamic Island loader on one cadence source and match in-app trail persistence; avoid additive step composition that changes speed.
- **Embrace startup threading**: Embrace 6.x capture services can assert queue constraints during startup (`dispatch_assert_queue` in `HangCaptureService`). Keep `Embrace.setup(...).start()` on `@MainActor`; do not wrap it in `Task.detached`.
- **Import progress timing**: PHPicker pre-loaded all images before showing progress, creating visible lag. Fix: pass `PHPickerResult` directly, set `importProgress` immediately on main actor, process incrementally (load → compress → encrypt → store → update). Also applies to file importer — set progress before `Task.detached`, not inside it.
- **Drag-to-select in grids**: Use PreferenceKey to collect cell CGRects, simultaneousGesture with DragGesture, direction-based activation (`dx > dy * 0.5` rejects vertical scrolls). First touched cell determines mode (select vs deselect). Track `dragAffectedIds` to prevent re-toggling. Replace Button with `.onTapGesture` to avoid gesture conflicts. Haptic via `UISelectionFeedbackGenerator().selectionChanged()`.
- **TestFlight internal groups**: Internal groups with `hasAccessToAllBuilds: true` automatically receive all builds — `asc builds add-groups` fails with "Cannot add internal group to a build." Don't try to manually assign builds to internal groups.
- **Free tier import enforcement**: Limit checks at the + button are insufficient — must also cap imports inside `handleSelectedPhotos`/`handleImportedFiles` to remaining free slots, import those, then show paywall if truncated.
- **Vault isolation security**: `Task.detached` with captured value-type keys is a security hazard — keys survive vault lock. Store task handles (`activeImportTask`), cancel on any vault key change (not just nil), and check `Task.isCancelled` after every async operation in import loops.
- **Batch storage operations**: Individual `deleteFile` calls do N load/save cycles (N crypto operations). Batch method with single load/save and blob-grouped file handle reuse provides 300x improvement.
- **Camera preview pattern**: `AVCaptureVideoPreviewLayer` as `override class var layerClass` is the correct pattern — creates the preview layer as the view's backing layer, auto-resizing without manual frame management. Sublayer approach has zero-frame issues.
- **ShareExtension version sync**: Always use `$(CURRENT_PROJECT_VERSION)` and `$(MARKETING_VERSION)` build setting variables in extension Info.plists — hardcoded values drift when main app bumps versions.
- **Structured logging pattern**: Subsystem `"app.vaultaire.ios"`, category matches class/feature name. Classes/actors use `private static let logger = Logger(...)` accessed via `Self.logger`. Structs/enums/views use file-level `private let xyzLogger = Logger(...)`. For `@MainActor` classes with `nonisolated` methods, MUST use file-level logger to avoid actor isolation issues. Log levels: `.trace()` for sensitive data (never log content), `.debug()` for routine ops, `.info()` for notable events, `.warning()` for non-fatal issues, `.error()` for failures. Privacy: `\(value, privacy: .public)` for non-sensitive interpolation.
- **SwiftUI gesture priority with TabView**: `.gesture()` on a TabView is a primary gesture that blocks internal paging. `.simultaneousGesture()` allows custom gestures and TabView paging to coexist. This is critical for drag-to-dismiss + page-swipe UX patterns.
- **Background timer alternatives**: `Timer.scheduledTimer` and `Timer.publish` both use RunLoop `.default` mode which stops in background. For background-critical updates (Dynamic Island, Live Activity), use `Task { while !Task.isCancelled { ... Task.sleep(for:) } }`. Apple's ActivityKit budget tolerates ~2 updates/sec.
- **Date grouping pattern**: `Calendar.startOfDay(for:)` for day bucketing, "Today"/"Yesterday" for relative days, `DateFormatter` with explicit `dateFormat` (not `doesRelativeDateFormatting`) for older dates. ISO8601 date string as unique group ID to handle cross-year title collisions. `LazyVStack(pinnedViews: .sectionHeaders)` with opaque `Color.vaultBackground` for headers.
- **Lock-screen sheet stability**: For sheets launched from `PatternLockView` that contain text input, keep keyboard-safe-area ignores on sheet roots and pin presentation detents to `.large` to avoid keyboard-triggered background jumps.
- **Maestro TextEditor fallback**: If an editor id is not discoverable, use `tapOn: point` before `inputText` instead of blocking on id selectors.
- **safeAreaInset spacing discipline**: Always set explicit spacing (`spacing: 0` when flush is required) for inset-driven top bars over scroll content to avoid unexpected seams.
- **Pattern create-step feedback discipline**: If both structured validation feedback and custom error messaging are possible, clear stale counterpart state on every branch and guard async checks with `isProcessing`.
- **Maestro install discipline**: After local code changes, reinstall the newly built simulator app before running Maestro to avoid false negatives from stale binaries.
- **Flow-state extraction for complex SwiftUI screens**: As interaction rules expand (step transitions, validation, async errors, test hooks), extract dedicated state structs with explicit transition methods and test them directly.
- **Batch consumed-state lookups**: Share lists/syncs should fetch consumed flags in one call, then map locally; per-share checks create avoidable N+1 behavior.
- **Single-pass visible-file derivation**: For media grids and viewers reading the same filtered set, compute once and reuse to reduce repeated O(n) work in `body`.
- **Lock-screen modal isolation**: Present lock-screen text-entry flows with full-screen presentation and opaque backgrounds to prevent keyboard-driven visual bleed/jump artifacts.
- **Pager stability over gesture richness**: For full-screen media paging, prioritize deterministic page snapping over drag-to-dismiss convenience when the two conflict.
- **Modal identity discipline**: Avoid tying modal identity to highly dynamic UI state (like current pager index); keep presentation identity stable and mutate internal state only.
- **Pager implementation choice**: If `TabView(.page)` remains unstable in production gestures, prefer `ScrollView` paging (`.scrollTargetBehavior(.paging)` + `.scrollPosition(id:)`) with explicit full-width pages.
- **Onboarding unlock parity**: Keep a single unlock-ceremony timeline shared by lock-screen unlock and onboarding completion so transition behavior stays identical across entry paths.
- **App-wide appearance mode**: Keep appearance mode in `AppState`, persist it in UserDefaults, and apply **exclusively** via `UIWindow.overrideUserInterfaceStyle`. **NEVER use `.preferredColorScheme()`** — it conflicts with UIKit window overrides and fails to revert from explicit (light/dark) back to system (.unspecified). Use `UIWindow.didBecomeKeyNotification` observer to catch new windows from fullScreenCovers/sheets.
- **ImportIngestor memory safety**: Never load entire encrypted files into memory for import. Use `CryptoEngine.decryptStagedFileToURL(from:to:with:)` which reads/decrypts via FileHandle with ~256KB peak memory for streaming format. Only single-shot files (≤1MB) are loaded into memory.
- **VaultFileItem createdAt**: Always pass `createdAt: Date()` when appending files to the in-memory `files` array. The default `nil` causes `groupFilesByDate` to treat files as `.distantPast` (December 31, year 0001). All 5 append sites in VaultView+Actions must include this.
- **@Binding + guard race condition**: When a child view sets `@Binding var isX = true` and calls `onAction()` in the same button, if the parent's function starts with `guard !isX else { return }`, the guard fails immediately because the binding already propagated. Always let the owning function set the guard flag.
- **Extension idle timer**: App extensions can't use `UIApplication.shared.isIdleTimerDisabled` directly. Use `NSClassFromString("UIApplication")` → `perform(NSSelectorFromString("sharedApplication"))` → `setValue(disabled, forKey: "idleTimerDisabled")` for runtime access.
- **File-as-progress-marker**: Delete input `.enc` files after each successful import. On crash+retry, missing `.enc` = already imported → skip. Zero additional state needed. Combined with `autoreleasepool` per iteration prevents OOM on large batches.
- **FileHandle streaming for large binary formats**: When building binary formats containing large blobs, write header fields to a small intermediate buffer and large content directly to FileHandle — avoids copying entire blob into a second Data buffer. `writeFileEntryStreaming` pattern: build small header Data, `handle.write(header)`, `handle.write(content)`.
- **Scope-based early deallocation**: Use `do {}` blocks to force `let` bindings out of scope early, triggering ARC deallocation before the enclosing function continues. Critical when decrypted and encrypted copies of the same file would otherwise coexist.
- **git stash push pathspec pitfall**: `git stash push -- file1 file2` may save diffs but leave working tree unchanged — always verify with `git diff` after stash. Manual edits may be needed to truly revert.
- **Staged import progress parity**: Route staged-import progress through `importProgress` and `localImportProgressContent`, with totals based on `.enc` payload existence, to keep feedback consistent and accurate.

### Session 61 — Share Vault First-Paint Latency (Feb 16, 2026)
- **Query**: Share Vault screen takes multiple seconds to populate and appears empty initially.
- **Approach**: Refactored `ShareVaultView` initialization to show local state immediately, moved index reads off main actor, and deferred CloudKit consumed-share reconciliation.
- **Fixes**:
  - Load local share snapshot (`estimatedUploadSize`, `activeShares`) via detached task and render immediately.
  - Run `checkiCloudStatus()` concurrently; only switch to unavailable mode after local first paint.
  - Stop loading full vault index on every 1s upload poll tick; only reload shares on explicit events (`sync up-to-date`, running uploads finishing).
  - Added generation guard to prevent stale async initialize results from overwriting newer state.
- **Validation**:
  - iOS simulator build succeeded.
  - iOS simulator tests passed: 285/285.
- **Key Learnings**:
  - Share screens must treat CloudKit/network checks as post-render reconciliation, not first-render prerequisites.
  - Repeated index decrypt/JSON decode in high-frequency timers causes avoidable UI lag.

## Error Tracker Updates (Session 61)
- **Share screen startup blocking**: Waiting for CloudKit account + consumed-state fetch before rendering local share data causes multi-second empty/loading states. Prevention: render from local index first, reconcile remote state asynchronously.

## Corrections and Preferences Updates (Session 61)
- Prefer two-phase share-screen loading: local state first, network consistency second.

## Anticipated Improvements Updates (Session 61)
- Add telemetry for `ShareVaultView` first-contentful-render and consumed-reconciliation duration to track regressions.

## Cumulative Learnings Update (Session 61)
- Performance-sensitive SwiftUI screens that depend on encrypted local stores should avoid synchronous local storage reloads in periodic polling loops.

### Session 62 — Enforce Duress/Sharing Mutual Exclusivity (Feb 16, 2026)
- **Query**: If a user enables duress and then shares the same vault in the same session, app still allows duress state; duress must be disabled and option blocked.
- **Approach**: Enforced policy at two layers: share-start (auto-clear duress) and settings policy/UI (include active upload jobs in sharing-state checks).
- **Fixes**:
  - `ShareUploadManager.startBackgroundUpload` now clears duress designation when sharing starts on that vault key.
  - `VaultSettingsView` now tracks active upload jobs for current vault fingerprint and treats them as sharing activity.
  - Duress toggle gating now uses unified helper `shouldDisableDuressForSharing(isSharedVault:activeShareCount:activeUploadCount:)`.
  - If settings detects sharing activity while duress is still set (stale/bypassed state), it auto-clears duress and updates UI.
- **Validation**:
  - iOS simulator build succeeded.
  - iOS simulator tests passed: 288/288.
  - Added tests for duress disable policy with shared vault, active shares, and active uploads.
- **Key Learnings**:
  - Policy checks based only on persisted shares (`activeShares`) miss same-session in-flight uploads; upload manager state must be included.

## Error Tracker Updates (Session 62)
- **Duress policy bypass via same-session share**: Restricting duress only by `index.activeShares` allows a window during in-flight upload where duress remains enabled. Prevention: include non-terminal upload jobs in duress eligibility checks and clear duress at share-start.

## Corrections and Preferences Updates (Session 62)
- For security-policy exclusivity rules, enforce in both initiating workflow (share start) and settings UI state reconciliation.

## Anticipated Improvements Updates (Session 62)
- Add an explicit user-facing toast/banner when duress is auto-disabled due to sharing to improve transparency.

## Cumulative Learnings Update (Session 62)
- Security mode gating should consume both persisted model state and transient manager state to prevent same-session loopholes.

### Session 63 — Share Upload Idle Timer Scope Fix (Feb 16, 2026)
- **Query**: Uploading a vault keeps the whole app from sleeping; no-sleep should apply only while user is explicitly on Share Vault screen.
- **Approach**: Added explicit visibility-gated idle policy in `ShareVaultView` to prevent off-screen refresh/task races from re-disabling sleep globally.
- **Fixes**:
  - Added `isShareScreenVisible` state toggled by `onAppear`/`onDisappear`.
  - `applyIdleTimerPolicy()` now uses `shouldDisableIdleTimer(isShareScreenVisible:uploadJobs:)` instead of upload-only condition.
  - Added tests for visible vs non-visible idle-timer gating behavior.
- **Validation**:
  - iOS simulator build succeeded.
  - iOS simulator tests passed: 290/290.
- **Key Learnings**:
  - View-scoped side effects controlled by global process state (like idle timer) need explicit visibility guards to avoid async task cancellation races.

## Error Tracker Updates (Session 63)
- **Idle-timer race after ShareVault dismissal**: Periodic refresh tasks may execute around dismissal and re-apply no-sleep. Prevention: gate idle timer by explicit view visibility, not upload status alone.

## Corrections and Preferences Updates (Session 63)
- For global UI process flags (`UIApplication` settings), always pair state predicates with screen visibility predicates.

## Anticipated Improvements Updates (Session 63)
- Consider an app-wide idle-timer coordinator (token-based ownership) to avoid cross-feature collisions between import/backup/share flows.

## Cumulative Learnings Update (Session 63)
- Global UIKit side-effects should be treated as owned resources; feature-local tasks must prove ownership (screen visible/active) before mutating them.

### Session 64 — Upload Failure When Switching Vaults During Share (Feb 16, 2026)
- **Query**: Switching vaults while an upload is in progress can produce failed upload state with "svdf_data.bin doesn't exist".
- **Root Cause**:
  - `ShareUploadManager` creates `pending_uploads/<jobId>/` before persisting `state.json` (during initial SVDF build).
  - Pending-state scans (`loadAllPendingUploadStates`) treated directories without `state.json` as invalid and deleted them.
  - Deleting that in-progress directory removed `svdf_data.bin`, causing subsequent upload step to fail.
- **Fix**:
  - Updated `loadAllPendingUploadStates` to skip (not delete) job directories that do not yet contain `state.json`.
  - Retained cleanup behavior for truly invalid states once `state.json` exists and fails validation.
  - Added regression test ensuring `hasPendingUpload` scan does not delete job directories missing `state.json`.
- **Validation**:
  - iOS simulator build succeeded.
  - iOS simulator tests passed: 291/291.
- **Key Learnings**:
  - Startup/scan logic must distinguish "in-progress incomplete state" from "corrupt stale state" to avoid destructive races.

## Error Tracker Updates (Session 64)
- **In-progress pending directory mistaken as corrupt**: A transient directory without `state.json` during upload preparation can be wrongly purged by scanner logic. Prevention: only validate/delete directories after `state.json` exists.

## Corrections and Preferences Updates (Session 64)
- For resumable upload persistence, never run destructive cleanup on partial state markers created by active jobs.

## Anticipated Improvements Updates (Session 64)
- Add explicit temporary marker file (`.preparing`) lifecycle in pending upload directories to make scanner semantics unambiguous.

## Cumulative Learnings Update (Session 64)
- File-system based state machines need monotonic transitions and scanner logic aligned with transition order to prevent race-triggered data loss.

### Session 65 — Shared Vault Join Loading Screen Polish (Feb 16, 2026)
- **Query**: The "joining shared vault" downloading screen looked broken/minimal (tiny pixel + sparse text) and needed a fix.
- **Approach**: Updated the shared-vault import empty-state component to reuse the app’s canonical loading indicator block and always show progress scaffolding from 0%.
- **Fixes**:
  - Reworked `importingProgressContent` in `VaultView+Grid` to use `VaultSyncIndicator(style: .loading, ...)` for consistent loader sizing/appearance.
  - Added always-visible linear progress + percent (clamped 0...100), including initial `0%` stage.
  - Kept stage text (`transferManager.currentMessage`) prominent and centered.
  - Wrapped content in a glass card for clearer visual structure during empty-state import.
- **Validation**:
  - iOS simulator build succeeded.
  - iOS simulator tests passed: 291/291.
- **Key Learnings**:
  - Progress UIs should render their structural scaffold immediately (track + percentage), even before first network progress callback, to avoid "stuck" perception.

## Error Tracker Updates (Session 65)
- **Perceived stuck loader at 0%**: Hiding progress UI until first callback can make users think import is broken. Prevention: always display baseline progress state (0% + stage label).

## Corrections and Preferences Updates (Session 65)
- Reuse `VaultSyncIndicator(style: .loading)` for full-screen/loading-card states to keep loader visual consistency.

## Anticipated Improvements Updates (Session 65)
- Consider exposing total file/chunk counts in `TransferStatus.importing` to show richer progress details (e.g., "file x of y").

## Cumulative Learnings Update (Session 65)
- Empty-state loading screens need a strong visual container and immediate progress context to prevent false-negative quality impressions.

### Session 66 — Shared Vault Join Retry After Interruption (Feb 16, 2026)
- **Query**: Joining a shared vault was interrupted (app minimized), retry resumed, then failed with local notification "Setup Failed".
- **Root Cause**:
  - `downloadSharedVault` marked manifest `claimed = true` before local import/index setup finished.
  - If setup was interrupted after download, next retry hit `alreadyClaimed` and failed.
- **Fixes**:
  - Added `markClaimedOnDownload` flag to `CloudKitSharingManager.downloadSharedVault` (default true for compatibility).
  - Updated background join/import path to call download with `markClaimedOnDownload: false`.
  - Added `CloudKitSharingManager.markShareClaimed(shareVaultId:)` and called it only after successful local import + index save.
  - `markShareClaimed` now throws when manifest lookup fails so warning logs reflect real failures.
- **Validation**:
  - iOS simulator build succeeded.
  - iOS simulator tests passed: 291/291.
- **Key Learnings**:
  - One-time claim state must commit at the end of recipient setup, not at transfer start, for interruption-safe retries.

## Error Tracker Updates (Session 66)
- **Premature share-claim commit**: Marking claim at download-time causes retry failures (`alreadyClaimed`) when setup/import is interrupted. Prevention: claim only after successful local setup commit.

## Corrections and Preferences Updates (Session 66)
- For one-time share phrases, treat `claimed` as a post-commit state transition tied to local setup success.

## Anticipated Improvements Updates (Session 66)
- Add an integration test for interrupted join flow (download success + import interruption + retry) to lock in claim timing behavior.

## Cumulative Learnings Update (Session 66)
- In resumable onboarding/setup pipelines, remote terminal state must be written only after local transaction durability.

### Session 67 — TestFlight Push Build 59 (Feb 16, 2026)
- **Query**: Push latest `main` to TestFlight.
- **Approach**:
  1. Bumped `CURRENT_PROJECT_VERSION` from 58 to 59 in `Vault.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj`.
  2. Archived with manual signing (`CODE_SIGN_STYLE=Manual`) to match project provisioning profile configuration.
  3. Exported/uploaded with ASC API key (`AuthKey_GGJ9L8Y97B.p8`) via `xcodebuild -exportArchive`.
  4. Polled ASC until build 59 appeared and reached `VALID`.
  5. Added build to TestFlight group `Internal Testers` (`e3b40c85-38bb-4994-a41b-9ed9dfc79c83`).
- **Validation**:
  - Archive succeeded (`/tmp/Vault.xcarchive`).
  - Export/upload succeeded (`Uploaded Vault`, `EXPORT SUCCEEDED`).
  - ASC build: `40753486-7633-497b-9ca7-69f1ae12fb2e`, version `59`, processing state `VALID`.
- **Key Learnings**:
  - For this project, forcing `CODE_SIGN_STYLE=Automatic` at archive-time conflicts with manual provisioning profile specifiers and fails archive.
  - `asc builds add-groups` rejects true internal-only groups with `Cannot add internal group to a build`; assign a distributable TestFlight group instead.

## Error Tracker Updates (Session 67)
- **Archive signing mode mismatch**: Overriding to automatic signing can conflict with manual profile specifiers configured in project targets. Prevention: archive with manual signing for release in this repo.

## Corrections and Preferences Updates (Session 67)
- Keep TestFlight release command sequence: archive (manual signing) -> export/upload with ASC API key -> poll `asc builds list` until `VALID` -> assign distributable group.

## Anticipated Improvements Updates (Session 67)
- Add a `scripts/release_testflight.sh` helper to standardize archive/export/poll/group steps and reduce manual mistakes.

## Cumulative Learnings Update (Session 67)
- Deterministic TestFlight shipping here depends on matching archive signing mode to pbxproj provisioning style and treating ASC indexing/group assignment as a second phase after upload.

### Session 68 — Shared Vault Join Black Side Gutters (Feb 16, 2026)
- **Query**: During shared-vault join/import screen, black bars appeared on left/right edges.
- **Root Cause**:
  - `VaultView` empty-state container did not force full-screen width/height.
  - In narrow-content empty states (shared-vault importing card), parent content sized to intrinsic width and background did not cover horizontal edges.
- **Fixes**:
  - Updated `emptyStateContent` in `VaultView+Grid` to use `.frame(maxWidth: .infinity, maxHeight: .infinity, alignment: .top)`.
  - Added accessibility id `vault_empty_state_container` for deterministic UI test coverage.
  - Updated Maestro flow `core/vault_empty_state.yaml` to assert the container id.
- **Validation**:
  - iOS simulator build succeeded.
  - iOS simulator tests passed: 291/291.
  - Maestro flow passed: `apps/ios/maestro/flows/core/vault_empty_state.yaml`.
- **Key Learnings**:
  - In SwiftUI, root `Group`/`VStack` containers in nav content can collapse to intrinsic width if not explicitly expanded; always force fill for full-screen background states.

## Error Tracker Updates (Session 68)
- **Intrinsic-width empty state causes side gutters**: Narrow content without `.frame(maxWidth: .infinity)` can expose window background as black side bars. Prevention: full-screen frame before background styling.

## Corrections and Preferences Updates (Session 68)
- For vault empty/import states, require a dedicated full-screen container id and Maestro assertion so layout regressions are caught quickly.

## Anticipated Improvements Updates (Session 68)
- Add a dedicated shared-vault importing Maestro flow with screenshot artifact checks to catch visual gutter regressions in join scenarios.

## Cumulative Learnings Update (Session 68)
- Full-screen visual states should be explicit in layout constraints, not implied by parent navigation/container behavior.

### Session 69 — Shared Vault Join Failures from Safari Invite Path (Feb 16, 2026)
- **Query**: Joining shared vault kept failing after interruption, especially from Safari/deep-link invite flow.
- **Root Cause**:
  - `SharedVaultInviteView.setupSharedVault()` initialized a new vault using legacy `VaultIndex(files:nextOffset:totalSize:)`.
  - That path defers critical index migration/bootstrap (encrypted master key + v3 blob metadata) until first storage operations, increasing fragility in background import setup.
- **Fixes**:
  - Replaced legacy index initialization in `SharedVaultInviteView` with `VaultStorage.loadIndex(with:)` + `saveIndex(...)`, matching `JoinVaultView`.
  - Added explicit import failure logging in `BackgroundShareTransferManager` catch block (localized error + dynamic type) for faster incident diagnosis.
- **Validation**:
  - iOS simulator build succeeded.
  - iOS simulator tests passed: 291/291.
- **Key Learnings**:
  - Join flows must use the same vault bootstrap primitive across all entry points; mixing legacy/modern index init paths creates hard-to-reproduce background import failures.

## Error Tracker Updates (Session 69)
- **Invite flow used legacy index bootstrap**: Deep-link join path can become unstable when it writes a v1-style index before import. Prevention: always seed vaults through `loadIndex(with:)` for v3-ready metadata.

## Corrections and Preferences Updates (Session 69)
- For shared-vault join reliability, treat `JoinVaultView` bootstrap as canonical and mirror it in `SharedVaultInviteView`.

## Anticipated Improvements Updates (Session 69)
- Add a dedicated integration/Maestro flow for deep-link invite accept path to lock in shared-vault setup parity with phrase-join flow.

## Cumulative Learnings Update (Session 69)
- Reliability regressions often come from entry-point drift: keep core setup primitives identical across manual join and deep-link invite routes.

### Session 70 — Embrace Events Not Appearing (Feb 16, 2026)
- **Query**: User reported they never see issues in Embrace and asked whether logs are being pushed.
- **Root Cause**:
  - Telemetry startup (`EmbraceManager.start`) was called from `Task.detached` in `AnalyticsManager`.
  - Embrace setup has main-queue affinity; detached startup can fail and leave `Embrace.client` nil, making `captureError` a no-op.
  - Additionally, telemetry is consent-gated (`analyticsEnabled`), so disabled consent also results in no events.
- **Fixes**:
  - Moved Embrace/Telemetry startup in `AnalyticsManager.startIfEnabled` and `setEnabled(true)` to `Task { @MainActor ... }`.
  - Removed unnecessary `await` calls after main-actor migration.
- **Validation**:
  - iOS simulator build succeeded.
  - iOS simulator tests passed: 291/291.
- **Key Learnings**:
  - Main-thread SDK initialization requirements must be enforced at call sites, not only documented in manager comments.

## Error Tracker Updates (Session 70)
- **Detached Embrace startup can silently disable telemetry**: If startup misses queue preconditions, `Embrace.client` remains nil and captured errors are dropped. Prevention: initialize on `@MainActor`.

## Corrections and Preferences Updates (Session 70)
- For telemetry diagnostics, always check both startup path correctness and analytics consent state before concluding ingestion issues.

## Anticipated Improvements Updates (Session 70)
- Add a lightweight telemetry health breadcrumb on launch (`embrace.started=true/false`) to quickly diagnose missing events in production.

## Cumulative Learnings Update (Session 70)
- Observability reliability depends on initialization thread semantics and user-consent state; either one can make error capture appear broken.

### Session 71 — TestFlight Push Build 60 (Feb 16, 2026)
- **Query**: Push latest `main` to TestFlight after telemetry fixes.
- **Approach**:
  1. Bumped `CURRENT_PROJECT_VERSION` from 59 to 60.
  2. Archived with manual signing (`CODE_SIGN_STYLE=Manual`) to match project provisioning.
  3. Exported/uploaded with ASC API key via `xcodebuild -exportArchive`.
  4. Polled ASC until build 60 was indexed and `VALID`.
  5. Added build to TestFlight group `Internal Testers`.
- **Validation**:
  - Archive succeeded (`/tmp/Vault_build60.xcarchive`).
  - Export/upload succeeded (`Upload succeeded`, `EXPORT SUCCEEDED`).
  - ASC build: `fbc3d32d-49c7-445f-9ddc-abfd6c9ee8d5`, version `60`, state `VALID`.
  - Group linkage verified via `asc testflight beta-groups relationships get --type builds`.
- **Key Learnings**:
  - `asc builds info` may lag group relationship updates; verify assignment through beta-group relationships for deterministic confirmation.

## Error Tracker Updates (Session 71)
- **Group assignment visibility lag**: Build info payload can appear without beta-group linkage immediately after `add-groups`. Prevention: verify via `beta-groups relationships`.

## Corrections and Preferences Updates (Session 71)
- Keep release verification 2-step: build state (`VALID`) + explicit group relationship confirmation.

## Anticipated Improvements Updates (Session 71)
- Add a small script to assert both conditions (`VALID` + group-linked) before reporting TestFlight push complete.

## Cumulative Learnings Update (Session 71)
- TestFlight release readiness should be treated as a composite condition across build processing and distribution linkage.

### Session 72 — Shared Vault Join Import CryptoKitError (Feb 16, 2026)
- **Query**: Join shared vault keeps failing; console shows `[import] IMPORT FAILED: ... CryptoKit.CryptoKitError error 3`.
- **Root Cause**:
  - Import loop used `CryptoEngine.decrypt(file.encryptedContent, with: shareKey)`.
  - For large shared files, `encryptedContent` can be VCSE streaming ciphertext generated by `encryptFileStreamingToHandle`.
  - Single-shot decrypt on streaming payload fails authentication (`CryptoKitError`).
- **Fixes**:
  - Updated join import path to use `CryptoEngine.decryptStaged(...)` (streaming-aware).
  - Added regression test `testBuildFullStreamingFromPlaintextLargeFileDecryptsWithDecryptStaged` in `SVDFSerializerTests`.
- **Validation**:
  - iOS simulator build succeeded.
  - iOS simulator tests passed: 292/292.
- **Key Learnings**:
  - Shared payload decryption mode must match payload format (single-shot vs streaming). Assuming single-shot for all shared files causes deterministic join failures on larger assets.

## Error Tracker Updates (Session 72)
- **Wrong decrypt API for streaming shared payloads**: Using `decrypt` instead of `decryptStaged` on VCSE ciphertext triggers CryptoKit auth failures in import. Prevention: always use format-aware decrypt APIs in share import code.

## Corrections and Preferences Updates (Session 72)
- When a log shows `CryptoKitError error 3` during shared import, first verify ciphertext format compatibility before suspecting key derivation.

## Anticipated Improvements Updates (Session 72)
- Add telemetry tag for import failure subtype (`streaming_decrypt_mismatch`, `key_derivation_failure`, etc.) to shorten triage loops.

## Cumulative Learnings Update (Session 72)
- CryptoKit auth failures in multi-format pipelines are often API-contract mismatches, not random corruption.

### Session 73 — Embrace Issues Visibility Hardening (Feb 16, 2026)
- **Query**: Embrace shows sessions but no actionable issues/logs; verify telemetry path so crashes/handled errors are debuggable.
- **Root Cause**:
  - App error capture path (`EmbraceManager.captureError`) only created a failed span with attributes.
  - In practice, that pattern can be visible in traces but not in Embrace dashboard issue-oriented views used for triage.
- **Fixes**:
  - Updated `EmbraceManager.captureError` to emit explicit exception logs via `Embrace.client?.log(..., severity: .error, type: .exception, stackTraceBehavior: .main)` with scrubbed structured attributes (type/domain/code/reason/context).
  - Kept span tagging for trace correlation.
  - Added startup health logs in `EmbraceManager.start` (`embrace_started`) and explicit `previous_run_crashed` exception log when `lastRunEndState == .crash`.
  - Replaced setup failure `print` with structured OSLog error for local diagnostics.
  - Resolved Swift concurrency warnings in `SpanHandle` by removing unnecessary `@Sendable` closure annotations that captured non-Sendable `Span`.
- **Validation**:
  - iOS simulator build succeeded.
  - iOS simulator tests passed: 292/292.
- **Key Learnings**:
  - For Embrace triage workflows, handled errors should be sent as log records with exception type and error severity; spans alone are insufficient for reliable issue surfacing.

## Error Tracker Updates (Session 73)
- **Embrace span-only error capture blind spot**: Encoding handled errors only as span failure attributes may not surface in issue dashboards. Prevention: emit explicit `.exception` logs with severity `.error`.

## Corrections and Preferences Updates (Session 73)
- For telemetry triage reliability, pair every handled-error capture with structured Embrace exception logs and include enough attributes for grouping (type/domain/code).

## Anticipated Improvements Updates (Session 73)
- Add a hidden diagnostics action in Settings to send a test Embrace exception log and return local confirmation when ingestion path is active.

## Cumulative Learnings Update (Session 73)
- "Session visible" is not equivalent to "error triage ready"; validate event type semantics (logs/exceptions) for the dashboard workflow teams actually use.

### Session 74 — Shared Vault Overwrite Confirmation (Feb 16, 2026)
- **Query**: When joining a shared vault with a pattern that already maps to an existing vault, overwrite instead of merge, and explicitly warn/ask for approval.
- **Root Cause**:
  - Join flows (`JoinVaultView`, `SharedVaultInviteView`) silently reused the resolved vault key with no overwrite confirmation UX.
  - There was no deterministic Maestro path to reach premium-gated join pattern setup in automation.
- **Fixes**:
  - Added overwrite confirmation alert to `JoinVaultView` and `SharedVaultInviteView`:
    - `Replace Existing Vault?`
    - Message includes file count and explicit non-merge warning.
    - `Cancel` keeps current flow, `Replace Vault` continues with forced overwrite.
  - Added overwrite handling before setup:
    - Delete existing vault index for the resolved pattern key.
    - Clear duress designation when the overwritten key is currently configured as duress.
    - Best-effort delete recovery mapping for the same key.
  - Added Maestro regression flow:
    - `maestro/flows/sharing/join_vault_overwrite_confirmation.yaml`.
    - Added `MAESTRO_PREMIUM_OVERRIDE` debug launch arg support in `SubscriptionManager` so premium-gated join flows are automatable.
  - Added deterministic debug hook in `JoinVaultView` for alert rendering in Maestro.
- **Validation**:
  - iOS simulator build succeeded.
  - iOS simulator tests passed: 292/292.
  - Maestro flow passed: `maestro/flows/sharing/join_vault_overwrite_confirmation.yaml`.
- **Key Learnings**:
  - For destructive pattern-collision paths, enforce explicit user confirmation even when no new privacy leak exists.
  - Premium gates should have deterministic test-only bypass hooks for CI/UI automation coverage.

## Error Tracker Updates (Session 74)
- **`.task(id:)` non-Equatable id crash/build break**: Using an enum with associated values as `.task(id:)` without `Equatable` conformance fails compilation. Prevention: conform id types to `Equatable` explicitly.
- **Maestro text assertion mismatch on long alert messages**: `assertVisible.text` may fail on substring-only regexes. Prevention: use `.*substring.*` when matching portions of accessibility text.

## Corrections and Preferences Updates (Session 74)
- For join/accept shared vault flows, treat existing local vault collision as a destructive action requiring an explicit confirm step.

## Anticipated Improvements Updates (Session 74)
- Add a follow-up Maestro branch that taps `Replace Vault` and verifies old vault index replacement with a deterministic fixture key.

## Cumulative Learnings Update (Session 74)
- Safe overwrite UX in security-sensitive apps should combine explicit consent, immediate local reset semantics, and deterministic automation coverage.

### Session 75 — Remove Dynamic Island + Background Transfer Reliability Hardening (Feb 17, 2026)
- **Query**: Remove Dynamic Island/Live Activity feature entirely and harden background reliability for sharing uploads, sync, and iCloud backup.
- **Root Causes**:
  - Dynamic Island code path had become high-churn and low-value, with residual project/runtime complexity.
  - Detached transfer/backup tasks had weak completion cleanup semantics (stale active-task state risk, background-task teardown race risk).
  - Resumed share uploads could repeat cloud finalize work when vault key was unavailable.
- **Fixes**:
  - Fully removed Live Activity feature surface from app target:
    - Removed `NSSupportsLiveActivities` from app Info.plist.
    - Removed `VaultLiveActivityExtension` target wiring from `Vault.xcodeproj` and deleted `VaultLiveActivity/*` sources.
    - Deleted `Vault/Models/TransferActivityAttributes.swift`.
  - Updated docs/tooling references to reflect no Live Activity target (`apps/ios/AGENTS.md`, `apps/ios/DESIGN.md`, `apps/ios/scripts/publish-testflight.sh`, loader comments).
  - Hardened `ShareUploadManager` resume/finalization:
    - Added persisted `uploadFinished` flag to pending state.
    - If cloud upload is finished but vault key is unavailable, job pauses in "finalize when unlocked" state without re-upload loop.
    - Resume with vault key finalizes locally by appending share record and clearing pending artifacts.
  - Hardened detached task cleanup patterns:
    - `BackgroundShareTransferManager`: added deterministic detached-task finalization that clears `activeTask` and ends the correct background task ID.
    - `iCloudBackupManager`: added single-flight auto-backup guard + deterministic background task teardown/state reset via main-queue sync helper.
- **Validation**:
  - iOS simulator build succeeded.
  - iOS simulator tests passed: 292/292.
- **Key Learnings**:
  - For detached background pipelines, stale manager state (`activeTask`/task IDs) is as damaging as explicit failures; cleanup must be deterministic on every exit path.
  - Persisting "upload finished, awaiting local finalization" state avoids unnecessary cloud churn when key material is temporarily unavailable.

## Error Tracker Updates (Session 75)
- **Detached task completion state leak risk**: Detached transfer/backup paths can finish without clearing manager task handles if cleanup is not centralized. Prevention: always run finalization helper that clears task state and ends captured background task IDs.
- **Pending upload re-upload loop while locked**: If upload completion state is not persisted, resume attempts can redundantly retry cloud finalize/upload work while vault key is unavailable. Prevention: persist an explicit `uploadFinished` checkpoint and defer local finalization only.

## Corrections and Preferences Updates (Session 75)
- Treat Dynamic Island/Live Activity as removed architecture; background transfer UX should rely on in-app surfaces + notifications, not ActivityKit.

## Anticipated Improvements Updates (Session 75)
- Add unit tests for pending upload state transitions (`uploadFinished=false -> true -> finalize on unlock`) to prevent regression in resume logic.

## Cumulative Learnings Update (Session 75)
- Reliable background transfer behavior is primarily lifecycle engineering: deterministic cleanup, resumable checkpoints, and explicit separation between cloud completion and local key-gated finalization.

### Session 76 — Maestro Suite Stabilization + TestFlight Push Build 64 (Feb 16, 2026)
- **Query**: Run Maestro and push to TestFlight.
- **Approach**:
  1. Rebuilt/reinstalled simulator app and executed full Maestro suite flow-by-flow.
  2. Fixed stale Maestro selectors/text and flaky launch-state assumptions.
  3. Added launch-helper handling for iOS permission alerts.
  4. Bumped `CURRENT_PROJECT_VERSION` from 63 to 64.
  5. Ran simulator tests and uploaded build to ASC with API key auth.
  6. Polled ASC until build appeared and reached `VALID`, then assigned TestFlight group.
- **Fixes**:
  - Updated camera/import flows to support both entry states (`vault_add_button` and `vault_first_files`).
  - Updated search sort flow label from `Date Added` to `Newest First`.
  - Updated app settings appearance selector usage (`app_appearance_setting` + `appearance_*` destination IDs).
  - Updated viewer flows to use deterministic photo tap point and current viewer controls.
  - Made batch export confirmation tap optional (`Export` dialog not always present before share sheet).
  - Replaced symlinked Maestro test media in `flows/core` with local files to avoid path-resolution instability.
  - Launch helpers now dismiss system prompts (`Don.*Allow`, `OK`) to prevent blocked waits.
- **Validation**:
  - Maestro full suite passed: `TOTAL=46 FAILED=0`.
  - iOS simulator tests passed: `292/292`.
  - ASC upload succeeded; build `64` reached `VALID`.
  - Build ID `7b9cae1b-bbef-41b1-a792-e492b1cf7657` added to group `Internal Testers` (`e3b40c85-38bb-4994-a41b-9ed9dfc79c83`).
- **Key Learnings**:
  - `launchApp clearState` can surface either empty or seeded-visible entry controls depending on runtime conditions; test flows should tolerate both when not state-critical.
  - iOS permission alerts can appear mid-suite and must be proactively dismissed in shared launch helpers.
  - Export actions in iOS can bypass intermediate confirmation and jump straight to share sheet.

## Error Tracker Updates (Session 76)
- **Maestro launch-state nondeterminism**: `launch_test_mode` cannot assume a single post-launch control (`vault_add_button` or `vault_first_files`). Prevention: helpers should stabilize on neutral readiness and flows should use fallback taps when state is intentionally flexible.
- **System permission prompt interference**: Camera/notification prompts can block helper assertions and create false failures. Prevention: include optional prompt dismissal commands in all common launch helpers.
- **Export confirmation branch variance**: Export flows may or may not present an intermediate `Export` confirmation. Prevention: keep confirmation taps optional unless the branch is explicitly under test.

## Corrections and Preferences Updates (Session 76)
- For release gates, require both full Maestro suite green and XCTest pass before TestFlight upload.
- Continue using ASC API key flags for `xcodebuild -exportArchive` to avoid account-session export failures.

## Anticipated Improvements Updates (Session 76)
- Add a dedicated reusable Maestro helper for opening file-import/camera entry points with built-in fallback handling.
- Add a small wrapper script to run all Maestro flows with per-flow logs and summarized fail list for faster triage.

## Cumulative Learnings Update (Session 76)
- Reliable UI automation in this app depends on resilient launch helpers (prompt handling + state-flexible entry points) and keeping flow selectors aligned with current accessibility IDs/text after UX changes.

### Session 77 — iCloud Backup Toggle Crash + Embrace Startup Timing (Feb 16, 2026)
- **Query**: App crashes when enabling "Backup to iCloud"; after that, opening App Settings crashes. Console also shows Embrace startup timing warning and missing issues in Embrace.
- **Root Causes**:
  - `iCloudBackupSettingsView.performBackup` could execute heavy backup pipeline on the UI actor path, and settings re-open/on-appear could retrigger backup while previous work was in-flight.
  - `AnalyticsManager.startIfEnabled` started Embrace through async `Task` from app launch flow, which delayed initialization and produced SDK startup timing warning.
- **Fixes**:
  - `iCloudBackupManager.performBackup` now offloads payload pack + encrypt/checksum/chunk preparation to background queues (`DispatchQueue.global`) before CloudKit upload.
  - `iCloudBackupSettingsView` hardened:
    - Main-actor task usage for iCloud-availability UI updates.
    - Re-entrancy guard (`guard !isBackingUp`) in `performBackup`.
    - Toggle-off now cancels/reset backup state and idle timer cleanly.
    - Captures backup errors to Embrace (`feature=icloud_backup_settings`).
  - Auto-backup background failures now capture to Embrace (`feature=icloud_auto_backup`).
  - `AnalyticsManager` now starts/stops telemetry synchronously on main (no async task deferral).
  - Moved telemetry startup earlier to `application(_:willFinishLaunchingWithOptions:)` in `AppDelegate`.
- **Validation**:
  - iOS simulator tests passed: 292/292.
  - Removed project-code concurrency warnings introduced during fix.
- **Key Learnings**:
  - In settings-driven async flows, CPU-heavy prep must be explicitly off-main even if API is async.
  - Launch-time telemetry must avoid async deferral if SDK requires pre-active startup semantics.

## Error Tracker Updates (Session 77)
- **Settings-triggered backup watchdog risk**: Heavy backup prep (payload build/encryption/chunking) on UI actor can freeze settings and be killed. Prevention: off-main prep + main-only UI updates.
- **Backup toggle re-entry race**: On-appear and toggle-change can both start backup, leading to unstable state. Prevention: single-flight guard with explicit cancel/reset on disable.
- **Embrace startup warning regression**: Launching Embrace via async task from `didFinishLaunching` can be interpreted as late startup by SDK. Prevention: synchronous main-thread start in `willFinishLaunching`.

## Corrections and Preferences Updates (Session 77)
- For telemetry SDKs with startup instrumentation, prefer deterministic synchronous launch wiring over async wrappers.

## Anticipated Improvements Updates (Session 77)
- Add a dedicated Maestro flow for premium iCloud backup toggle path (with deterministic test hook for iCloud availability) to lock in this regression fix.

## Cumulative Learnings Update (Session 77)
- Stability bugs in settings screens often come from actor/executor mismatch, not business logic; heavy async work still needs explicit executor design.

### Session 78 — Welcome Screen Feature Copy Truncation (Feb 16, 2026)
- **Query**: On initial onboarding screen, feature description sentences were truncated with ellipses; all copy must be fully readable.
- **Root Cause**:
  - Welcome screen vertical layout could compress `FeatureRow` text under tighter heights/dynamic text, causing one-line truncation.
- **Fixes**:
  - Reworked `WelcomeView` layout into a scroll-safe structure (`GeometryReader` + `ScrollView` + content `minHeight` equal to viewport).
  - Made `FeatureRow` text explicitly non-compressible/wrapping (`lineLimit(nil)` + `fixedSize(horizontal: false, vertical: true)` for title and description).
  - Expanded Maestro onboarding welcome flow assertions to verify full feature sentences are visible.
- **Validation**:
  - Maestro flow passed: `apps/ios/maestro/flows/onboarding/welcome_screen.yaml`.
  - iOS simulator tests passed: 292/292.
- **Key Learnings**:
  - For text-heavy onboarding surfaces, vertical centering with plain spacers is fragile; use scroll-safe containers plus explicit text wrapping constraints to avoid hidden/truncated product messaging.

## Error Tracker Updates (Session 78)
- **Onboarding copy truncation under constrained height**: Feature descriptions can silently collapse to one line with ellipses. Prevention: scroll-safe layout + fixed-size wrapping text and explicit UI test assertions for full copy.

## Corrections and Preferences Updates (Session 78)
- On marketing/onboarding screens, verify long copy visibility with Maestro text assertions (not just title/button presence).

## Anticipated Improvements Updates (Session 78)
- Add a dedicated Maestro run profile with larger Dynamic Type to catch copy truncation regressions earlier.

## Cumulative Learnings Update (Session 78)
- Layout resilience for onboarding content is a core quality requirement; copy visibility needs structural layout safeguards and automated checks.

### Session 79 — Change Pattern Completion Phrase Truncation (Feb 16, 2026)
- **Query**: On final "Pattern Changed" screen, recovery phrase text is truncated with ellipsis; user asked to remove top 3-step indicator on last screen and show full phrase.
- **Root Cause**:
  - `.complete` step reused generic step chrome (progress capsules + title/subtitle) and centered spacer layout, leaving insufficient vertical room for long generated phrase content.
- **Fixes**:
  - In `ChangePatternView`, hide progress indicator and title/subtitle when `step == .complete`.
  - Render completion content inside `ScrollView` for small-height resilience.
  - Use shared `PhraseDisplayCard` for recovery phrase on completion screen (same pattern as other phrase surfaces).
- **Validation**:
  - Maestro passed: `settings/change_pattern.yaml` (rerun standalone after one concurrent-run artifact).
  - Maestro passed: `settings/change_pattern_error_replacement.yaml`.
  - iOS simulator tests passed: 292/292.
- **Key Learnings**:
  - Reusing wizard-step chrome on terminal success states can reduce critical content visibility; success states need their own space budget and scrolling fallback.

## Error Tracker Updates (Session 79)
- **Terminal-step chrome compression**: Final success screens with duplicated headers/progress can hide critical user data (recovery phrase). Prevention: conditionally remove non-essential chrome and enable scroll on terminal states.

## Corrections and Preferences Updates (Session 79)
- For recovery phrase displays, prioritize full visibility over strict visual consistency with earlier steps.

## Anticipated Improvements Updates (Session 79)
- Add a deterministic Maestro hook that jumps `ChangePatternView` to `.complete` with a long synthetic phrase to directly assert non-truncation.

## Cumulative Learnings Update (Session 79)
- Security-critical copy/phrases must be treated as non-truncatable content; terminal UI states should be designed from that constraint first.

### Session 80 — Phrase Download Buttons No-Op (Feb 16, 2026)
- **Query**: Download button on phrase screens did nothing; fix across all screens.
- **Root Cause**:
  - Phrase download and link-share actions used fragile presenter lookup (`connectedScenes.first` + `keyWindow`). In some UI states this returned no valid presenter, so `UIActivityViewController` was never shown.
- **Fixes**:
  - Hardened shared presenter path in `ShareSheetHelper`:
    - Prefer foreground-active `UIWindowScene`.
    - Resolve key/visible window robustly.
    - Present from top-most visible VC (handles nav/tab/presented stacks).
    - Call completion on failure paths to avoid leaked temp files.
  - Updated `PhraseActionButtons.downloadPhrase()` to use `ShareSheetHelper.present(...)` (applies across all phrase surfaces).
  - Updated `ShareVaultView` link share action to use the same helper for consistency.
- **Validation**:
  - Maestro passed: `settings/recovery_phrase.yaml`.
  - Maestro passed: `settings/custom_recovery_phrase.yaml`.
  - iOS simulator tests passed: 292/292.
- **Key Learnings**:
  - Share-sheet no-ops are often presenter-resolution failures rather than UI button wiring bugs; centralizing presentation logic prevents drift across features.

## Error Tracker Updates (Session 80)
- **Share sheet silent no-op**: Presenting from an invalid root controller (or wrong scene) causes buttons to appear broken with no user feedback. Prevention: single shared topmost-presenter helper with foreground scene selection.

## Corrections and Preferences Updates (Session 80)
- For cross-feature actions (copy/share/download), always route through shared presenter utilities instead of per-screen ad hoc UIKit presentation.

## Anticipated Improvements Updates (Session 80)
- Add a dedicated Maestro check that taps `Download` on a phrase screen and asserts a share-sheet anchor text appears.

## Cumulative Learnings Update (Session 80)
- Centralized UIActivity presentation is a reliability requirement for iOS multi-scene apps; ad hoc root-controller lookups regress easily.

### Session 81 — Onboarding Trust Messaging Refresh (Feb 16, 2026)
- **Query**: Replace generic trust copy on onboarding "Thank You" step with direct privacy-by-design messaging (no accounts, no PII, no backdoors, only user can decrypt).
- **Fixes**:
  - Updated `ThankYouView` copy:
    - Title: `Protected by Design`
    - Subtitle: `No accounts. No personal data. No backdoors.`
    - Card title/body: explicit "no spying" + "only your pattern can decrypt"
    - CTA: `Create My Secure Vault`
  - Updated onboarding Maestro assertions:
    - `maestro/flows/onboarding/thankyou_screen.yaml`
    - `maestro/flows/onboarding/skip_paywall.yaml`
- **Validation**:
  - Maestro passed: `maestro/flows/onboarding/thankyou_screen.yaml`.
  - Maestro passed: `maestro/flows/onboarding/skip_paywall.yaml`.
  - iOS simulator tests passed: 292/292.
- **Key Learnings**:
  - Trust messaging performs better when it states concrete system guarantees instead of gratitude language.
  - Any onboarding copy change must include matching Maestro assertion updates.

## Error Tracker Updates (Session 81)
- **Onboarding copy/test drift**: Updating onboarding text without test alignment causes avoidable CI failures. Prevention: update `thankyou_screen` + `skip_paywall` assertions in the same change.

## Corrections and Preferences Updates (Session 81)
- Prefer punchy, guarantee-driven copy for security positioning: state constraints (`no accounts`, `no backdoors`) and control boundary (`only your pattern decrypts`).

## Anticipated Improvements Updates (Session 81)
- Add optional assertions for the new card headline/body in onboarding Maestro flow so future edits don't regress core privacy claims.

## Cumulative Learnings Update (Session 81)
- Security onboarding copy is product-critical behavior and should be treated like feature logic: single source of truth in `ThankYouView`, validated by dedicated UI flow assertions.

### Session 82 — TestFlight Push Build 65 (Feb 16, 2026)
- **Query**: Push latest `main` to TestFlight.
- **Approach**:
  - Bumped iOS build number from `64` to `65` in `Vault.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj`.
  - Archived Release build for `Vault` target.
  - Exported IPA (`build/export/Vault.ipa`).
  - Published via `asc publish testflight --wait` to `Internal Testers`.
- **Validation**:
  - Archive succeeded.
  - Export succeeded.
  - ASC publish result:
    - `buildId`: `15a5d7ba-6b87-46b9-96c1-7097a37c8681`
    - `buildNumber`: `65`
    - `buildVersion`: `1.0.1`
    - `processingState`: `VALID`
    - Group assigned: `Internal Testers` (`e3b40c85-38bb-4994-a41b-9ed9dfc79c83`)
- **Key Learnings**:
  - `asc publish testflight` is the fastest reliable path for this repo when auth is already configured in macOS keychain.

## Error Tracker Updates (Session 82)
- **Duplicate TestFlight build risk**: Re-uploading without bumping `CURRENT_PROJECT_VERSION` fails/gets ignored. Prevention: bump build number before archive for every new TestFlight push.

## Corrections and Preferences Updates (Session 82)
- Prefer a single-command publish flow (`asc publish testflight --wait`) after IPA export to reduce manual group-assignment drift.

## Anticipated Improvements Updates (Session 82)
- Add a tiny release helper to auto-increment build number and call archive/export/publish in one deterministic script.

## Cumulative Learnings Update (Session 82)
- For rapid beta iteration, keep release work linear: bump build, archive/export, publish with `--wait`, and record returned `buildId` for traceability.

### Session 83 — Import From Library No-Op Regression (Feb 16, 2026)
- **Query**: Adding files regressed; selecting photos from library appears to do nothing.
- **Root Cause**:
  - Vault auto-lock was wired to `UIApplication.willResignActiveNotification`. This notification can fire for transient system UI transitions (including picker/share-related flows), clearing `currentVaultKey` mid-import and causing selection callbacks to no-op.
- **Fixes**:
  - Moved lock trigger in `ContentView` from `willResignActive` to `didEnterBackground` so lock happens on actual background transitions.
  - In `VaultView`, tied `appState.suppressLockForShareSheet` to picker visibility (`showingPhotoPicker || showingFilePicker`) so import picker transitions never race vault key teardown.
  - Strengthened `maestro/flows/core/import_from_library.yaml` to perform real picker selection + confirmation and assert vault exits empty state.
- **Validation**:
  - Maestro passed: `maestro/flows/core/import_from_library.yaml` (select + confirm path).
  - Maestro passed: `maestro/flows/core/import_from_files.yaml`.
  - iOS simulator tests passed: 292/292.
- **Key Learnings**:
  - `willResignActive` is not a safe proxy for “user left app”; use background-entry notifications for lock policies, then explicitly suppress lock around approved transient system UI.

## Error Tracker Updates (Session 83)
- **Import no-op after picker selection**: Clearing vault state on transient resign-active events can make import callbacks silently abort. Prevention: lock on background-entry only and maintain suppression around system picker flows.

## Corrections and Preferences Updates (Session 83)
- For secure lock behavior, prefer strict “entered background” semantics over generic focus-loss semantics.

## Anticipated Improvements Updates (Session 83)
- Add a dedicated regression Maestro flow that asserts lock screen is not shown after returning from import picker selection path.

## Cumulative Learnings Update (Session 83)
- Security controls should be precise about lifecycle boundaries; over-broad lock triggers can degrade core UX and look like data-path failures.

### Session 84 — Onboarding Custom Phrase Keyboard Layout Fix (Feb 16, 2026)
- **Query**: In onboarding recovery step (custom phrase), keyboard covered the "I've saved it" button and pushed screen so progress/header top was clipped.
- **Root Cause**:
  - Recovery step used spacer-centered vertical layout with the CTA in the normal content stack, so keyboard compression moved both top and bottom critical UI off-screen.
- **Fixes**:
  - Refactored `PatternSetupView` recovery step:
    - Replaced spacer-centered recovery layout with `ScrollView` (`recoveryScrollSection`).
    - Moved recovery CTA (`recovery_saved`) into a bottom `safeAreaInset` action bar so it remains visible above keyboard.
    - Added keyboard toolbar "Done" action to dismiss keyboard cleanly.
    - Added `recovery_custom_phrase_input` accessibility identifier.
  - Added DEBUG-only Maestro hook `-MAESTRO_FORCE_ONBOARDING_RECOVERY` to force onboarding directly to recovery step for deterministic keyboard-layout regression testing.
  - Added new flow `maestro/flows/onboarding/custom_phrase_keyboard_layout.yaml`.
- **Validation**:
  - Maestro passed: `maestro/flows/onboarding/custom_phrase_keyboard_layout.yaml`.
  - iOS simulator tests passed: 292/292.
- **Key Learnings**:
  - Input-heavy onboarding steps should pin primary actions with safe-area insets and keep content scrollable; spacer-centered layouts are fragile under keyboard.

## Error Tracker Updates (Session 84)
- **CTA hidden by keyboard in onboarding**: Vertically centered stacks with text input can hide primary actions and headers when keyboard appears. Prevention: scrollable body + bottom safe-area action bar + keyboard-dismiss affordance.

## Corrections and Preferences Updates (Session 84)
- For recovery phrase and other security-critical setup steps, never rely on users dismissing keyboard manually to reach the primary action.

## Anticipated Improvements Updates (Session 84)
- Add a parallel Maestro variant with smaller device height to stress-test onboarding keyboard-safe layouts.

## Cumulative Learnings Update (Session 84)
- Keyboard-safe onboarding design should be treated as a functional requirement, not just visual polish, because hidden actions block account/vault setup completion.

### Session 85 — Welcome Screen Sentence Line-Break Formatting (Feb 17, 2026)
- **Query**: Improve first-screen copy presentation by forcing a newline in "True Plausible Deniability" description after the first sentence.
- **Fixes**:
  - Updated `WelcomeView` feature copy to include explicit newline:
    - `"Nobody can tell how many vaults you have.\nEvery pattern shows a vault."`
  - Updated `maestro/flows/onboarding/welcome_screen.yaml` assertion to be whitespace-tolerant:
    - `Nobody can tell how many vaults you have\\.\\s*Every pattern shows a vault\\.`
- **Validation**:
  - Maestro passed: `maestro/flows/onboarding/welcome_screen.yaml`.
  - iOS simulator tests passed: 292/292.
- **Key Learnings**:
  - Maestro text assertions should account for intentional line breaks using regex whitespace matching.

## Error Tracker Updates (Session 85)
- **Exact-text assertion fragility with line breaks**: Assertions using literal spaces can fail after intentional `\n` formatting changes. Prevention: use `\\s*` tolerant regex in UI flow checks.

## Corrections and Preferences Updates (Session 85)
- For first-impression onboarding copy, intentional line breaks are acceptable when they improve scanability; keep tests robust to that formatting.

## Anticipated Improvements Updates (Session 85)
- Add one more onboarding assertion for "True Plausible Deniability" section header proximity to ensure future typography tweaks don’t separate heading and description awkwardly.

## Cumulative Learnings Update (Session 85)
- Presentation-level copy formatting changes still need deterministic automation updates; whitespace-robust checks avoid false regressions.

### Session 86 — Trust Screen Visual Redesign (Feb 17, 2026)
- **Query**: Improve onboarding trust screen aesthetics: split "No accounts. No personal data. No backdoors." onto separate lines; remove hero lock/card block; use first-screen style icon-led messaging.
- **Fixes**:
  - Reworked `ThankYouView`:
    - Removed large lock hero and glass card block.
    - Added multiline subtitle:
      - `No accounts.`
      - `No personal data.`
      - `No backdoors.`
    - Replaced middle content with icon-led `FeatureRow` list (`No accounts`, `No way to spy`, `No backdoors`) for visual consistency with onboarding welcome screen.
    - Kept CTA `Create My Secure Vault` and switched to scroll-safe layout.
  - Updated `maestro/flows/onboarding/thankyou_screen.yaml` subtitle assertion to whitespace-tolerant multiline regex.
- **Validation**:
  - Maestro passed: `maestro/flows/onboarding/thankyou_screen.yaml`.
  - Maestro passed: `maestro/flows/onboarding/skip_paywall.yaml`.
  - iOS simulator tests passed: 292/292.
- **Key Learnings**:
  - For onboarding copy rendered in a single multiline `Text`, assertions should target combined regex with `\\s*` rather than per-line exact matches.

## Error Tracker Updates (Session 86)
- **Multiline subtitle assertion mismatch**: Single-line asserts fail when SwiftUI renders one multiline `Text` node. Prevention: use a combined regex assertion tolerant to line breaks/spacing.

## Corrections and Preferences Updates (Session 86)
- On trust/security onboarding surfaces, prefer concise icon-led bullets over decorative cards when clarity and scanability are the goal.

## Anticipated Improvements Updates (Session 86)
- Add a visual snapshot check for `ThankYouView` under larger Dynamic Type to ensure icon rows remain readable and balanced.

## Cumulative Learnings Update (Session 86)
- Onboarding visual polish should preserve structural consistency between steps; reusing established row patterns makes copy hierarchy clearer and easier to maintain.

### Session 87 — Vault Settings Background Theme Regression (Feb 17, 2026)
- **Query**: Vault settings screen background turned system black and no longer matched app color scheme.
- **Root Cause**:
  - `VaultSettingsView` used a bare `List` without explicit themed background overrides, so iOS default grouped styling took over.
- **Fixes**:
  - Updated `VaultSettingsView` list styling:
    - `.listStyle(.insetGrouped)`
    - `.scrollContentBackground(.hidden)`
    - `.background(Color.vaultBackground.ignoresSafeArea())`
    - `.toolbarBackground(Color.vaultBackground, for: .navigationBar)`
    - `.toolbarBackground(.visible, for: .navigationBar)`
- **Validation**:
  - Maestro passed: `maestro/flows/settings/vault_settings.yaml`.
  - Verified simulator screenshot shows themed background (no black fallback).
  - iOS simulator tests passed: 292/292.
- **Key Learnings**:
  - Any SwiftUI `List`-based settings surface should explicitly hide system scroll content background and set themed nav/list background to prevent OS default drift.

## Error Tracker Updates (Session 87)
- **System background fallback on settings list**: Unstyled `List` can silently regress to black grouped appearance in dark mode. Prevention: enforce themed list + nav background modifiers on settings root views.

## Corrections and Preferences Updates (Session 87)
- For consistency-critical screens (settings, onboarding), include at least one visual verification screenshot pass after styling changes.

## Anticipated Improvements Updates (Session 87)
- Add a lightweight visual assertion flow for Vault Settings that checks a themed element unique to the app palette.

## Cumulative Learnings Update (Session 87)
- Theme consistency in SwiftUI settings UIs requires explicit list and toolbar background control; relying on defaults is brittle across appearance modes/iOS updates.

### Session 88 — Unlock Top-Area Black Flash Fix (Feb 17, 2026)
- **Query**: During vault unlock transition, top area briefly appeared black then slowly filled with app background.
- **Root Cause**:
  - Transition path did not guarantee a persistent themed root background while views cross-faded.
  - `VaultView` navigation bar/top area lacked explicit toolbar background theming, allowing system default black to appear transiently.
- **Fixes**:
  - In `ContentView`, added a persistent base layer:
    - `Color.vaultBackground.ignoresSafeArea()`
  - In `VaultView`, enforced themed nav bar:
    - `.toolbarBackground(Color.vaultBackground, for: .navigationBar)`
    - `.toolbarBackground(.visible, for: .navigationBar)`
- **Validation**:
  - Maestro passed: `maestro/flows/core/unlock_pattern.yaml`.
  - Maestro passed: `maestro/flows/core/vault_empty_state.yaml`.
  - iOS simulator tests passed: 292/292.
- **Key Learnings**:
  - Unlock/fade transitions should always have a stable themed root layer beneath animated content to prevent OS fallback flashes.

## Error Tracker Updates (Session 88)
- **Top safe-area black flash during unlock**: Missing explicit root/nav background under animated transitions can expose system black for a frame sequence. Prevention: themed root background + explicit navigation toolbar background in primary vault screen.

## Corrections and Preferences Updates (Session 88)
- For any animated screen handoff (lock -> vault, onboarding -> vault), audit both root and nav safe-area color ownership.

## Anticipated Improvements Updates (Session 88)
- Add a short unlock-transition visual regression recording step to release checklist for manual pre-TestFlight QA.

## Cumulative Learnings Update (Session 88)
- Visual consistency bugs often come from transitional ownership of safe-area/nav backgrounds, not static screen layout.

### Session 89 — Remove App-Level Duress Pattern Setting (Feb 17, 2026)
- **Query**: Remove "Duress pattern" from app settings since duress is configured per vault.
- **Fixes**:
  - Removed `NavigationLink("Duress pattern")` from `AppSettingsView`.
  - Removed unused `AppSettingsDestination` enum in `SettingsView.swift`.
- **Validation**:
  - Maestro passed: `maestro/flows/settings/app_settings.yaml`.
  - Maestro passed: `maestro/flows/settings/vault_settings.yaml`.
  - iOS simulator tests passed: 292/292.
- **Key Learnings**:
  - Dual duress entry points (global + per-vault) create policy ambiguity; keep duress ownership scoped to vault settings.

## Error Tracker Updates (Session 89)
- **Duplicate security control surfaces**: Exposing the same security concept in both global and vault-scoped settings leads to contradictory UX. Prevention: keep a single authoritative settings surface.

## Corrections and Preferences Updates (Session 89)
- Prefer vault-scoped duress controls only; avoid global duress pattern configuration in app settings.

## Anticipated Improvements Updates (Session 89)
- Add a lightweight settings flow assertion that `app_duress_pattern` is absent while `settings_duress_toggle` remains present.

## Cumulative Learnings Update (Session 89)
- Security settings should have one clear ownership boundary in the UI; remove redundant entry points even when functionally harmless.

### Session 90 — Restore From Backup Black Side Gutters Fix (Feb 17, 2026)
- **Query**: Restore-from-backup screens showed black lines/gutters on left/right edges and inconsistent theming.
- **Root Cause**:
  - `RestoreFromBackupView` painted background on a content-sized `Group`; state branches (`restoreContentView`/`successView`) did not own full-screen width, exposing system black at edges.
  - Navigation bar background was not explicitly themed in this view.
- **Fixes**:
  - Replaced root body container with full-screen `ZStack` + `Color.vaultBackground.ignoresSafeArea()`.
  - Kept state content in a `Group` but forced full-screen layout via `.frame(maxWidth: .infinity, maxHeight: .infinity, alignment: .top)`.
  - Added `.toolbarBackground(Color.vaultBackground, for: .navigationBar)` and `.toolbarBackground(.visible, for: .navigationBar)`.
- **Validation**:
  - iOS simulator tests passed: 292/292.
  - Maestro passed: `maestro/flows/settings/app_settings.yaml`.
  - Maestro passed: `maestro/flows/premium/icloud_backup.yaml` (rerun sequentially after one parallel Maestro artifact).
- **Key Learnings**:
  - For modal/restore flows, never rely on `.background` attached to content-sized stacks/groups for app theming coverage.

## Error Tracker Updates (Session 90)
- **Black side gutters in modal flow**: Content-sized background layers can expose system black edges on full-screen/sheet states. Prevention: full-screen ZStack background + explicit nav toolbar background.

## Corrections and Preferences Updates (Session 90)
- Treat every restore/onboarding/modal state branch as full-screen themed surfaces; avoid default UI fallbacks anywhere.

## Anticipated Improvements Updates (Session 90)
- Add a Maestro restore-screen visual check (with seeded backup metadata) that asserts themed background continuity at edges.

## Cumulative Learnings Update (Session 90)
- Background ownership must be at the view root for any full-screen flow; branch-local backgrounds are not reliable for visual consistency.

### Session 91 — Restore Pattern Board Position Consistency (Feb 17, 2026)
- **Query**: Align restore-from-backup pattern board to the same on-screen position as other pattern screens and guard against future drift.
- **Root Cause**:
  - `RestoreFromBackupView.restoreContentView` used a top-stacked layout (metadata + subtitle + grid + single trailing spacer), placing the grid too high compared to the standard pattern-screen scaffold.
- **Fixes**:
  - Refactored `restoreContentView` to match the shared pattern-screen structure:
    - header block (backup metadata + fixed-height subtitle)
    - `Spacer`
    - centered 280x280 interaction area (pattern grid or restoring progress)
    - `Spacer`
    - bottom placeholder/error area
  - Added `restore_pattern_grid` accessibility identifier for targeted regression checks.
- **Validation**:
  - iOS simulator tests passed: 292/292.
  - Maestro passed: `maestro/flows/settings/app_settings.yaml` (sequential rerun after one parallel Maestro artifact).
  - Maestro passed: `maestro/flows/premium/icloud_backup.yaml`.
- **Key Learnings**:
  - Pattern-board position consistency depends on scaffold symmetry (spacers above and below), not just grid size.

## Error Tracker Updates (Session 91)
- **Pattern board vertical drift**: Header-only top stacking pushes the board out of alignment with other flows. Prevention: enforce symmetric spacer scaffold for all pattern-entry screens.

## Corrections and Preferences Updates (Session 91)
- Treat pattern board position as a fixed UX invariant across unlock/verify/restore contexts.

## Anticipated Improvements Updates (Session 91)
- Add a dedicated restore-flow Maestro fixture with seeded backup metadata so `restore_pattern_grid` visibility and position can be asserted deterministically.

## Cumulative Learnings Update (Session 91)
- Pattern UI consistency requires shared layout structure, not just shared `PatternGridView` styling.

### Session 92 — Thorough Validation + TestFlight Push Build 66 (Feb 17, 2026)
- **Query**: "When done, test thoroughly and push to testflight."
- **Approach**:
  - Ran full iOS simulator tests.
  - Ran targeted Maestro smoke suite for touched settings/restore/theme paths plus core import/unlock checks.
  - Bumped iOS build number from `65` to `66`.
  - Archived, exported IPA, and published to TestFlight with wait-for-processing.
- **Validation**:
  - iOS simulator tests passed: 292/292.
  - Maestro passed:
    - `maestro/flows/settings/app_settings.yaml`
    - `maestro/flows/settings/vault_settings.yaml`
    - `maestro/flows/premium/icloud_backup.yaml`
    - `maestro/flows/core/unlock_pattern.yaml`
    - `maestro/flows/core/vault_empty_state.yaml`
    - `maestro/flows/core/import_from_library.yaml`
- **Release Output**:
  - `buildId`: `04c4bf59-6ee9-40ef-9028-f85476dd5111`
  - `buildNumber`: `66`
  - `buildVersion`: `1.0.1`
  - `processingState`: `VALID`
  - Group: `Internal Testers` (`e3b40c85-38bb-4994-a41b-9ed9dfc79c83`)
- **Key Learnings**:
  - For rapid release cadence, `asc publish testflight --wait` gives deterministic completion metadata and avoids manual post-upload checks.

## Error Tracker Updates (Session 92)
- **Archive cleanup policy block**: Shell policy can reject destructive cleanup flags (`rm -rf`) in release commands. Prevention: use fresh archive/export paths instead of deleting paths in-line.

## Corrections and Preferences Updates (Session 92)
- Prefer sequential Maestro runs for release gating to reduce noise from intermittent Maestro logger artifacts during parallel runs.

## Anticipated Improvements Updates (Session 92)
- Add a tiny release helper script that runs the standard smoke suite, bumps build number, archives, exports, and calls `asc publish testflight --wait`.

## Cumulative Learnings Update (Session 92)
- A deterministic TestFlight lane for this app is: test_sim + targeted Maestro smoke -> bump build -> archive/export -> `asc publish testflight --wait`.

### Session 93 — App Settings Black Background Regression Sweep (Feb 17, 2026)
- **Query**: App Settings in TestFlight still had default black background; user requested a full sweep to prevent default surfaces.
- **Root Cause**:
  - `AppSettingsView` used a default `List` without explicit themed list/nav background modifiers.
  - Related settings subviews (`AppearanceSettingsView`, `iCloudBackupSettingsView`, and duress settings view) also lacked a complete consistent modifier set.
- **Fixes**:
  - Added consistent settings theming to all settings `List` screens:
    - `.listStyle(.insetGrouped)`
    - `.scrollContentBackground(.hidden)`
    - root `.background(Color.vaultBackground.ignoresSafeArea())` (or root ZStack with vault background)
    - `.toolbarBackground(Color.vaultBackground, for: .navigationBar)` + `.toolbarBackground(.visible, for: .navigationBar)`
  - Updated `iCloudBackupSettingsView` to a root `ZStack` background so unavailable/available states both sit on themed surfaces.
- **Validation**:
  - iOS simulator tests passed: 292/292.
  - Maestro passed:
    - `maestro/flows/settings/app_settings.yaml`
    - `maestro/flows/settings/vault_settings.yaml`
    - `maestro/flows/premium/icloud_backup.yaml`
    - `maestro/flows/core/unlock_pattern.yaml`
    - `maestro/flows/core/vault_empty_state.yaml`
    - `maestro/flows/onboarding/welcome_screen.yaml`
    - `maestro/flows/onboarding/thankyou_screen.yaml`
- **Key Learnings**:
  - Theming regressions in production were from subview-level omissions, not just the primary settings screen.

## Error Tracker Updates (Session 93)
- **Default List surface leak in release**: Missing list/nav background modifiers on nested settings screens can pass casual checks but ship black defaults in TestFlight. Prevention: enforce one shared settings-list modifier pattern across all settings subviews.

## Corrections and Preferences Updates (Session 93)
- Any screen using `List` in settings must be treated as a full-screen themed surface, not a local content block.

## Anticipated Improvements Updates (Session 93)
- Extract a reusable `vaultSettingsListStyle()` view modifier to remove per-screen drift risk.

## Cumulative Learnings Update (Session 93)
- Visual consistency requires enforcing theme ownership at every screen entry point, especially nested settings destinations.

### Session 94 — Recovery Phrase Error Styling Consistency (Feb 17, 2026)
- **Query**: Recovery sheet error was styled differently and effectively invisible.
- **Root Cause**:
  - `RecoveryPhraseInputView` rendered error text in `vaultHighlight` on a `vaultHighlight`-tinted background (`vaultGlassTintedBackground`), causing poor contrast and inconsistency with other app error surfaces.
- **Fixes**:
  - Replaced recovery error block with standard app error presentation:
    - `Label("Recovery Failed", systemImage: "exclamationmark.triangle.fill")` in `vaultHighlight`
    - Body text in `vaultSecondaryText`
    - Container on `vaultGlassBackground(cornerRadius: 12)`
  - Added accessibility id `unlock_recovery_error`.
  - Added Maestro regression flow:
    - `maestro/flows/core/recovery_phrase_error_visibility.yaml`
    - Asserts invalid phrase path shows readable error title/body.
- **Validation**:
  - iOS simulator tests passed: 292/292.
  - Maestro passed: `maestro/flows/core/recovery_phrase_error_visibility.yaml`.
  - Maestro passed: `maestro/flows/core/locked_sheet_keyboard_stability.yaml`.
- **Key Learnings**:
  - Consistent error styling is not just visual polish; contrast failures can make critical security UX appear broken.

## Error Tracker Updates (Session 94)
- **Low-contrast error regression**: Highlight-colored text on similarly tinted backgrounds can hide errors entirely. Prevention: reserve accent/highlight for title/icon only; body text uses secondary/readable contrast.

## Corrections and Preferences Updates (Session 94)
- For lock/recovery surfaces, always prefer shared glass error containers over one-off tinted error pills.

## Anticipated Improvements Updates (Session 94)
- Reuse a shared `VaultErrorCard` component across lock/recovery/settings to eliminate per-screen error-style drift.

## Cumulative Learnings Update (Session 94)
- Security-recovery flows need both functional and visual consistency checks; add direct Maestro assertions for error readability.

### Session 95 — Trust Screen Restructure (Top Image + Feature List) (Feb 17, 2026)
- **Query**: Restructure onboarding trust screen to: top image, "Protected by Design" title, existing item list, add "Hidden from all: Nobody can tell how many vaults you have", and remove subtitle block.
- **Fixes**:
  - Updated `ThankYouView` layout:
    - Added top `VaultLogo` image (styled like onboarding visuals).
    - Kept title `Protected by Design`.
    - Removed multiline subtitle block (`No accounts / No personal data / No backdoors`).
    - Added new feature row:
      - Title: `Hidden from all`
      - Description: `Nobody can tell how many vaults you have.`
  - Updated onboarding Maestro assertions in `maestro/flows/onboarding/thankyou_screen.yaml`.
- **Validation**:
  - iOS simulator tests passed: 292/292.
  - Maestro passed: `maestro/flows/onboarding/thankyou_screen.yaml` (rerun after one transient XCTest tap conflict).
  - Maestro passed: `maestro/flows/onboarding/skip_paywall.yaml`.
- **Key Learnings**:
  - Trust-step content is most readable when the hierarchy mirrors Welcome (visual anchor + concise title + scannable rows + CTA).

## Error Tracker Updates (Session 95)
- **Onboarding tap conflict artifact**: Maestro may throw transient "only one gesture can be performed at a time" despite valid UI. Prevention: rerun the affected flow sequentially before treating as product regression.

## Corrections and Preferences Updates (Session 95)
- On trust messaging screens, prefer row-based claims over subtitle blocks for scanability and consistency.

## Anticipated Improvements Updates (Session 95)
- Add a tiny onboarding visual snapshot check for `ThankYouView` so top-logo/title/list hierarchy regressions are caught early.

## Cumulative Learnings Update (Session 95)
- Keeping onboarding step structure consistent across screens improves readability and reduces iterative design drift.

### Session 96 — TestFlight Push Build 67 (Feb 17, 2026)
- **Query**: "Push to testflight."
- **Approach**:
  - Confirmed iOS build number bump to `67`.
  - Archived (`Vault67.xcarchive`), exported IPA (`build/export67/Vault.ipa`), and published with `asc publish testflight --wait`.
- **Release Output**:
  - `buildId`: `2730e93b-0f3c-42e2-8b9a-396058d9a12f`
  - `buildNumber`: `67`
  - `buildVersion`: `1.0.1`
  - `processingState`: `VALID`
  - Group: `Internal Testers` (`e3b40c85-38bb-4994-a41b-9ed9dfc79c83`)
- **Validation**:
  - Archive succeeded.
  - IPA export succeeded.
  - TestFlight publish completed and returned `uploaded: true`.
- **Key Learnings**:
  - `asc publish testflight --wait --output json` remains the fastest deterministic lane for upload + processing + group assignment confirmation.

## Error Tracker Updates (Session 96)
- No new product/runtime errors observed in this release-only task.

## Corrections and Preferences Updates (Session 96)
- For release-only tasks, prefer unique archive/export directories per build number instead of reusing paths.

## Anticipated Improvements Updates (Session 96)
- Add a tiny shell wrapper for archive/export/publish that auto-names paths with build numbers and captures JSON output.

## Cumulative Learnings Update (Session 96)
- Keeping release artifacts versioned by build number (`Vault67.xcarchive`, `export67`) reduces cleanup risk and improves traceability.

### Session 97 — Appearance Transition Uniformity + Unlock Top Repaint Fix (Feb 17, 2026)
- **Query**: Appearance switching repaints top/bottom at different speed; unlock shows unwanted top recoloring.
- **Root Cause**:
  - UIKit style overrides were applied without explicitly stabilizing window/root background surfaces, allowing transient mismatched layers during trait changes.
  - `ContentView` had implicit root `.animation` modifiers on unlock/loading/onboarding state changes, causing animated transitions across large container/safe-area layers.
- **Fixes**:
  - Updated `AppState.applyAppearanceToAllWindows()`:
    - apply style inside `UIView.performWithoutAnimation` + disabled `CATransaction` actions
    - set both `window.backgroundColor` and `window.rootViewController?.view.backgroundColor` to `VaultBackground`
    - keep style + background updates atomic per window.
  - Updated `AppState.setAppearanceMode(_:)`:
    - no-op if unchanged
    - write `appearanceMode` with `withAnimation(.none)` before applying windows.
  - Updated `ContentView`:
    - removed implicit root `.animation(..., value: appState.isUnlocked/showOnboarding/isLoading)` to prevent top-only recolor artifacts during unlock transitions.
- **Validation**:
  - iOS simulator tests passed: 292/292.
- **Key Learnings**:
  - Appearance switches must update style + root surfaces together, without implicit animations, to avoid split repaint across safe areas.

## Error Tracker Updates (Session 97)
- **Split safe-area repaint on theme switch**: Updating interface style without synchronizing window/root background surfaces can show top/bottom recolor lag. Prevention: atomic no-animation style + background update for every window.

## Corrections and Preferences Updates (Session 97)
- Root-level state transitions in `ContentView` should not use broad implicit `.animation` on unlock/loading/onboarding when visual uniformity is required.

## Anticipated Improvements Updates (Session 97)
- Add a targeted Maestro visual-regression flow for appearance switch (dark<->light) and unlock transition to catch safe-area repaint seams.

## Cumulative Learnings Update (Session 97)
- For global theming stability, treat `window.overrideUserInterfaceStyle` and root background color as a single operation and disable implicit animations during the switch.

### Session 98 — TestFlight Push Build 68 (Feb 17, 2026)
- **Query**: "Push to testflight."
- **Approach**:
  - Ran full simulator tests and targeted Maestro smoke for appearance/unlock flows.
  - Bumped iOS build number from `67` to `68`.
  - Archived/exported and published via `asc publish testflight --wait`.
- **Validation**:
  - iOS simulator tests passed: 292/292.
  - Maestro passed:
    - `apps/ios/maestro/flows/settings/appearance_mode.yaml`
    - `apps/ios/maestro/flows/core/unlock_pattern.yaml`
- **Release Output**:
  - `buildId`: `b310fbf8-82fe-4248-b2a0-2f4bb05e7a48`
  - `buildNumber`: `68`
  - `buildVersion`: `1.0.1`
  - `processingState`: `VALID`
  - Group: `Internal Testers` (`e3b40c85-38bb-4994-a41b-9ed9dfc79c83`)
- **Key Learnings**:
  - Keep release smoke commands rooted at `apps/ios` since Maestro flows are stored under `apps/ios/maestro/flows`.

## Error Tracker Updates (Session 98)
- No new app/runtime regressions observed in this release lane.

## Corrections and Preferences Updates (Session 98)
- For this repo, run Maestro release-smoke commands from `apps/ios` (not monorepo root) to avoid path mismatches.

## Anticipated Improvements Updates (Session 98)
- Add a release script that wraps simulator tests + `apps/ios` Maestro smoke + build bump + `asc publish`.

## Cumulative Learnings Update (Session 98)
- A reliable release lane is: `test_sim` + `apps/ios` Maestro smoke -> bump build -> archive/export -> `asc publish testflight --wait`.

### Session 99 — New Design Docs for App + Monorepo (Feb 17, 2026)
- **Query**: "Write up the design doc for the app and the overall project and store it in the docs folder."
- **Approach**:
  - Audited current repo structure (`apps/ios`, `web`, existing docs) and current architecture touchpoints (sharing, backup, extension, testing).
  - Added two new source-of-truth docs:
    - `docs/overall-project-design.md`
    - `docs/ios-app-design.md`
  - Updated docs index:
    - `docs/README.md` now links both new docs.
- **Validation**:
  - Verified docs are present and linked from `docs/README.md`.
- **Key Learnings**:
  - Existing architecture docs are useful but mixed in age/scope; splitting monorepo design vs iOS app design keeps updates focused and easier to maintain.

## Error Tracker Updates (Session 99)
- No runtime/code errors; docs-only change.

## Corrections and Preferences Updates (Session 99)
- For design documentation requests, create explicit scope-separated docs (project-level vs app-level) instead of expanding one legacy architecture file.

## Anticipated Improvements Updates (Session 99)
- Add a lightweight docs-lint/checklist for stale links in `docs/README.md` so index drift is caught early.

## Cumulative Learnings Update (Session 99)
- Architecture knowledge stays maintainable when documentation is split by boundary: monorepo design in `docs/`, implementation-deep iOS references in `apps/ios/docs/`.

### Session 100 — Accent Color Variant Update (Feb 17, 2026)
- **Query**: Change accent color variants to `#1F0D77` for light mode and `#CCC3F8` for dark mode.
- **Approach**:
  - Updated `apps/ios/Vault/Resources/Assets.xcassets/AccentColor.colorset/Contents.json` directly.
  - Set universal (light) variant to `#1F0D77`.
  - Set dark luminosity variant to `#CCC3F8`.
  - Kept unrelated local modifications (`ContentView.swift`, `VaultApp.swift`) untouched.
- **Validation**:
  - Verified asset catalog JSON values match requested hex colors.
- **Key Learnings**:
  - Accent experiments should stay asset-driven so all SwiftUI `AccentColor` usage updates globally without per-view edits.

## Error Tracker Updates (Session 100)
- No code/runtime errors; design-token-only update.

## Corrections and Preferences Updates (Session 100)
- For color requests, edit semantic asset tokens first, not view-level modifiers.

## Anticipated Improvements Updates (Session 100)
- Consider adding a tiny color-token snapshot test (or lint) to catch accidental hardcoded accent values.

## Cumulative Learnings Update (Session 100)
- Brand accent adjustments are safest when made only at the `AccentColor.colorset` source of truth.

### Session 101 — Fix ITMS-90863 MetricKit Mac Support Warning (Feb 17, 2026)
- **Query**: App Store Connect warning for build 70: `ITMS-90863` (links `/usr/lib/swift/libswiftMetricKit.dylib`, unavailable on macOS).
- **Root Cause**:
  - App target was configured with `SUPPORTS_MAC_DESIGNED_FOR_IPHONE_IPAD = YES`, so ASC validated Mac Designed for iPhone/iPad compatibility.
  - Current telemetry dependency chain links MetricKit (`MetricKit.framework` + `libswiftMetricKit.dylib`) in the iOS binary.
- **Fixes**:
  - Updated app target build settings in `apps/ios/Vault.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj`:
    - `SUPPORTS_MAC_DESIGNED_FOR_IPHONE_IPAD = NO` (Debug + Release for app target).
  - Kept `SUPPORTS_MACCATALYST = NO` unchanged.
- **Validation**:
  - `xcodebuild -showBuildSettings` now reports:
    - `SUPPORTS_MAC_DESIGNED_FOR_IPHONE_IPAD = NO`
  - Simulator debug build succeeded (`** BUILD SUCCEEDED **`).
- **Key Learnings**:
  - For iOS-only distribution with SDKs that pull Mac-unavailable Swift libs (e.g., MetricKit), opting out of Mac Designed for iPhone/iPad at build-setting level prevents recurring ITMS-90863 warnings.

## Error Tracker Updates (Session 101)
- **ITMS-90863 warning path**: MetricKit-linked iOS binaries trigger Mac compatibility warnings when `SUPPORTS_MAC_DESIGNED_FOR_IPHONE_IPAD` is enabled. Prevention: set it to `NO` unless Mac distribution is an explicit product requirement.

## Corrections and Preferences Updates (Session 101)
- Treat ITMS delivery warnings as release blockers for next binary and patch build settings in-project, not just manually in App Store Connect toggles.

## Anticipated Improvements Updates (Session 101)
- Add a release preflight grep for `SUPPORTS_MAC_DESIGNED_FOR_IPHONE_IPAD` to catch unintended re-enablement.

## Cumulative Learnings Update (Session 101)
- Mac Designed for iPhone/iPad distribution must be intentionally enabled; if disabled in-project, App Store compatibility checks for unavailable macOS Swift dylibs stop surfacing.

### Session 102 — TestFlight Build 72 Publish (Feb 17, 2026)
- **Query**: "Send it to testflight"
- **Approach**:
  - Verified local/remote build state (`CURRENT_PROJECT_VERSION` and ASC latest build).
  - Bumped build number `71 -> 72`.
  - Ran simulator test gate (`xcodebuild test`) and recovered from an initial stale simulator launch error by booting a concrete simulator UUID before rerun.
  - Archived release build, exported IPA, then uploaded/distributed with `asc publish testflight --wait`.
- **Validation**:
  - `xcodebuild test` passed: `292/292`.
  - Archive/export succeeded (`Vault.ipa` generated).
  - ASC result: `uploaded=true`, `processingState=VALID`, `buildNumber=72`, `buildId=8a2692bf-b107-4a5c-8b41-cc651bea3f96`.
- **Key Learnings**:
  - Even when a simulator UUID appears in `-showdestinations`, test launch can still fail with SimError 404; explicitly booting a target device and rerunning against that booted UUID is a reliable recovery path.

## Error Tracker Updates (Session 102)
- **xcodebuild test stale-destination edge**: `Unable to boot deleted device` can occur intermittently during test launch. Prevention: `simctl shutdown all`, `simctl boot <UUID>`, wait with `bootstatus -b`, rerun with that UUID.

## Corrections and Preferences Updates (Session 102)
- For TestFlight shipping, continue using `asc publish testflight --wait` after local archive/export so upload, processing, and group assignment return one definitive JSON status.

## Anticipated Improvements Updates (Session 102)
- Add a tiny preflight helper script that boots a known simulator destination before the test gate to avoid first-run stale destination failures.

## Cumulative Learnings Update (Session 102)
- Reliable TestFlight lane remains: bump build -> simulator test gate -> archive/export IPA -> `asc publish testflight --wait` and confirm `processingState=VALID`.

### Session 103 — Fix OOM Crash When Scrolling Large Vault (Feb 17, 2026)
- **Query**: Fix out-of-memory crash when user adds many files and scrolls — three compounding issues
- **Approach**: Two-fix implementation (third fix deferred due to Swift type-checker limits):
  1. **Moved encrypted thumbnails out of VaultFileItem**: `encryptedThumbnail: Data?` (30-60KB each) replaced with `hasThumbnail: Bool`. Encrypted data stored in `ThumbnailCache` actor's new `encryptedThumbnails: [UUID: Data]` dictionary. Updated all 8 VaultFileItem creation sites, AsyncThumbnailView, FullScreenPhotoViewer video path.
  2. **Conditional cellFrames**: Wrapped GeometryReader preference in `if isEditing` in both PhotosGridView and FilesGridView. Added `.onChange(of: isEditing)` to clear dictionary when editing ends.
  3. **Deferred: computeVisibleFiles caching**: Attempted `@State cachedVisible` approach but body expression exceeded Swift type-checker limits (pre-existing fragility). Left as-is — body calls once + toolbar calls once = 2 total, much better than the previous 3+ calls.
- **Files modified**: ThumbnailCache.swift, VaultView.swift, VaultView+Actions.swift, AsyncThumbnailView.swift, PhotosGridView.swift, FilesGridView.swift, FullScreenPhotoViewer.swift, SecureImageViewer.swift, SecureVideoPlayer.swift, DateGroupingTests.swift, VaultFileItemTests.swift
- **Validation**: Build succeeded (no project warnings), 303 tests pass (292 unit + 11 UI), 0 failures
- **Key Learnings**:
  - VaultView body is at the Swift type-checker complexity limit — adding any `@State` + `.onChange` + usage in body can trigger "unable to type-check in reasonable time". Avoid adding new state that's consumed in body.
  - When moving data out of a view model into a cache actor, add both `storeEncrypted` and a `decryptAndCache(id:masterKey:)` overload that fetches from internal storage — avoids callers needing to know the cache's internal layout.
  - `if isEditing { GeometryReader { ... } }` is safe in SwiftUI backgrounds — the modifier is simply not applied when false, avoiding PreferenceKey dictionary growth.

## Error Tracker Updates (Session 103)
- **Swift type-checker body limit**: VaultView.body is at the complexity ceiling. Adding `@State` + `.onChange` + body consumption can trigger `unable to type-check this expression in reasonable time`. Prevention: avoid new state variables consumed in body; prefer pushing computed data to child views or using simpler invalidation patterns.

## Anticipated Improvements Updates (Session 103)
- Consider decomposing VaultView.body further (e.g., extract NavigationStack content into separate computed property) to give the type checker headroom for future changes.
- For Fix 3 retry: use a separate view wrapper or EnvironmentObject to pass precomputed visible files without adding state to VaultView body.

## Cumulative Learnings Update (Session 103)
- SwiftUI @State arrays holding Data blobs are a major memory hazard — every body evaluation diffs the entire array. Move bulk data to actor-isolated caches and keep only lightweight flags in view state.
