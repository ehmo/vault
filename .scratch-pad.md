# Scratch Pad — Continual Learning Log

## Session Log

### Session 1 — UX Design Audit Implementation (Feb 8, 2026)
- **Query**: Implement 11-workstream UX design audit plan (WS1-WS11) across the Vaultaire iOS app
- **Approach**: Sequential workstream implementation with build verification and git commit after each
- **Errors**:
  - `.foregroundStyle(.accentColor)` fails — `ShapeStyle` has no member `accentColor`. Fix: use `Color.accentColor`
  - `bd update ○` failed — passed status indicator character instead of issue ID. Fix: use `bd list` to get actual ID
- **Corrections**: None from user — autonomous implementation
- **Key Learnings**:
  - Codable optionals (`Date?`) provide backward compat for existing vault indexes without migration
  - When adding files to pbxproj manually, use `UX` prefix IDs for UX-related additions (consistent with `LA`, `SE` prefixes)
  - `SubscriptionManager.maxFreeFilesPerVault` is a static constant (100) — reference directly, don't duplicate the value
  - Date grouping with photo viewer requires computing global index across all sorted images, not per-group index

## Error Tracker

- **ShapeStyle vs Color**: `.foregroundStyle(.accentColor)` doesn't compile — `accentColor` is on `Color`, not `ShapeStyle`. Always use `Color.accentColor` or `.tint(.accentColor)`.
- **Beads ID parsing**: `bd` commands need the actual issue ID (e.g., `VAULT-5vs`), not display characters. Always run `bd list` first if unsure.
- **SourceKit false positives**: Cross-file SourceKit diagnostics ("Cannot find X in scope") are common in this project and don't represent real build errors. Trust `xcodebuild` results over editor diagnostics.

---

## Corrections and Preferences

- **Commit frequency**: User prefers commit + push after every successful build. Don't accumulate changes.
- **Beads tracking**: Use beads for multi-session work, TodoWrite for single-session tasks.
- **Plan mode**: Make plans extremely concise. Sacrifice grammar for brevity.
- **Subagent model**: Always use opus model for subagents.

---

## Anticipated Improvements

- Always wrap `Color.accentColor` (not bare `.accentColor`) in `.foregroundStyle()` calls
- Run `bd list` before closing issues to confirm IDs exist
- When adding optional fields to Codable structs, always provide default `nil` in init for backward compat
- When modifying grid views that feed into a full-screen viewer, verify the index mapping is global not local

## Cumulative Learnings

- **Session count**: 1
- **Build success rate**: 10/11 first-attempt (1 fix for accentColor)
- **Key pattern**: Sequential workstream implementation with build gates works well for large multi-file UX changes
- **Architecture insight**: This codebase uses a 3-tier file model (VaultFileItem → LightweightFileEntry → VaultFileEntry) — changes to file metadata must propagate through all three
