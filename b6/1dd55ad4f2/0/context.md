### Prompt 1

Implement the following plan:

# Custom Paywall: Version A (Compare, Then Choose)

## Context
Current paywall uses RevenueCatUI's default `PaywallView()` with a single $9.99 lifetime product. Need to redesign with 3 tiers (Monthly $1.99, Yearly $9.99, Lifetime $29.99), a benefits comparison table, and 7-day free trial on yearly — all in Vaultaire's design language.

### Prompt 4

Push to testflight

### Prompt 5

The background screen also jumps when I use recovery phrase and tap into the text area. Make sure that this is fixed across the board

### Prompt 6

When setting up custom phrase in the vault, the design changes from the empty state (image 10) to text area being in focus (image 11) pushing everything up. The keyboard also hides the button (image 12) which is unreachable. We need to fix this. We should also add button at the right corner to the opposite side of cancel so user can just accept it there.

### Prompt 8

The "regenerate recovery phrase" screen in a vault looks very different (image 13) from the design we are using in the onboarding (image 14) and elsewhere. It's important that the design is equal across the board
