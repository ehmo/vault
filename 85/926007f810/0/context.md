## User Prompts

### Prompt 1

Look at the top. I want to adopt this dotten line where each separation is one screen on the onboarding (instead of the full line we are using).

Similarly as we have implemented on the onboarding feature screen at the bottom. Also I want to add skip like it's on the paywall screen on the first screen and every feature screen of the onboarding. When pressed it should bring user to the notification permission screen
