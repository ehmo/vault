Do a deep review of seo benefits of publishing articles about a topic on my own domain that is fairly recent or on substack or other places. I got dozens of search terms and keywords that I got from google keywords analyzer and other tools that will help to target specific keywords. But I wonder where should I publish them. Should I publish them under the vaultaire.app which is a new domain with very little authority or some other places that can bring better and higher authority.

Do very extensive analysis and propose solution. This should be an ongoing marketing effort.

Store this analysis in /docs for later
