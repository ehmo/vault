Implement the following plan:

# Plan: File Optimization/Compression During Import

## Context

Vault files are stored at full original size, consuming significant storage. Research shows 80%+ reduction is achievable at high visual quality using modern codecs (HEIC for images, HEVC for video). This warrants a simple two-option setting: **Optimized** (default) vs **Original**.

## Design: Two Options

Research confirms ≥80% reduction at high quality:
- **Images**: HEIC at quality 0.6 via `CGImageDestination` → 75-85% smaller, visually identical
- **Videos**: HEVC 1080p via `AVAssetExportSession` → 85-90% smaller, excellent quality
- **Other files** (PDF, docs, ZIP): Pass through unchanged — no reliable compression without quality loss

Setting: `@AppStorage("fileOptimization")` with values `"optimized"` (default) / `"original"`

## Implementation

### 1. New file: `apps/ios/Vault/Core/Storage/MediaOptimizer.swift`

Actor with two public methods:

```swift
actor MediaOptimizer {
    static let shared = MediaOptimizer()

    enum Mode: String { case optimized, original }

    /// Returns (outputURL, outputMimeType, wasOptimized)
    /// If wasOptimized, caller must delete temp file after use
    func optimize(fileURL: URL, mimeType: String, mode: Mode) async throws -> (URL, String, Bool)

    /// For UIImage from camera — writes HEIC to temp file (avoids jpegData memory spike)
    func optimizeImage(_ image: UIImage, mode: Mode) async throws -> (URL, String)
}
```

**Image pipeline** (HEIC via ImageIO, file-to-file):
1. `CGImageSourceCreateWithURL` from source
2. If >4096px on long edge: `CGImageSourceCreateThumbnailAtIndex` to downsample
3. `CGImageDestinationCreateWithURL` → write HEIC at quality 0.6
4. Skip if source is already HEIC. Skip non-image types.
5. Peak memory: ~20-50MB (one image bitmap)

**Video pipeline** (HEVC via AVFoundation):
1. `AVURLAsset` from source
2. `AVAssetExportSession(asset:, presetName: AVAssetExportPresetHEVC1920x1080)`
3. Export to temp `.mp4`
4. Skip if source is already HEVC at ≤1080p
5. Peak memory: ~30-80MB (stream-based, independent of video length)

**Passthrough**: Non-media files return input URL with `wasOptimized = false`

### 2. Modify: `apps/ios/Vault/Features/Settings/SettingsView.swift`

Add "Storage" section to AppSettingsView with a Picker:
- **Optimized** (default): "Reduces file sizes by up to 85%. Uses HEIC for images and HEVC for videos."
- **Original**: "Keeps files at original size and format. Uses significantly more storage."

### 3. Modify: `apps/ios/Vault/Features/VaultViewer/VaultView+Actions.swift`

Read `@AppStorage("fileOptimization")` and pass mode to optimizer.

**`handleCapturedImage`** (camera):
- Current: `image.jpegData(compressionQuality: 0.8)` → `storeFile(data:)` (loads ~48MB bitmap into Data)
- New: `MediaOptimizer.optimizeImage(image, mode:)` → temp HEIC file → `storeFileFromURL` (streaming encryption, bounded memory)

**`performPhotoImport`** (photo picker):
- Images: Write UIImage to temp file → `MediaOptimizer.optimize(fileURL:)` → `storeFileFromURL`
- Videos: `MediaOptimizer.optimize(fileURL:)` → `storeFileFromURL` (already URL-based)

**`performFileImport`** (file picker):
- Videos: `MediaOptimizer.optimize(fileURL:)` → `storeFileFromURL`
- Other: Pass through to `storeFileFromURL` unchanged

### 4. Modify: `apps/ios/Vault/Core/Storage/ImportIngestor.swift`

In `processImport`: optimize staged file before `storeFileFromURL`. Read mode from `UserDefaults.standard.string(forKey: "fileOptimization")` (can't use @AppStorage in non-view).

### 5. Filename/mimeType updates

When optimized (e.g., `.jpg` → `.heic`, `.mov` → `.mp4`), update stored `filename` extension and `mimeType` to reflect actual format. Use the `outputMimeType` returned by optimizer.

## Files Changed

| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `Core/Storage/MediaOptimizer.swift` | **NEW** — HEIC/HEVC optimization actor |
| `Features/Settings/SettingsView.swift` | Add Storage section with optimization picker |
| `Features/VaultViewer/VaultView+Actions.swift` | Route imports through optimizer, fix camera memory |
| `Core/Storage/ImportIngestor.swift` | Optimize staged files before encryption |

## Verification

1. Build succeeds with no warnings in project code
2. Import a 12MP JPEG → stored as HEIC, file ~75-85% smaller
3. Import a 4K MOV → stored as HEVC 1080p MP4, ~85-90% smaller
4. Import a PDF → stored unchanged
5. Toggle setting to "Original" → files stored as-is, original size
6. Camera capture → HEIC file, no 48MB jpegData memory spike
7. Memory stays bounded during batch imports (check with Instruments)
8. Existing tests pass

update the scratch pad and the docs with the new features. I want to use these in the marketing materials

---

I want to redesign the website. I have gotten few templates I want to build on. First of all, these are all DESIGNS so ignore the logo and the overall text.

This is the baseline design I would like to use /Users/nan/Downloads/design-4379e9c9-dbc6-4207-b977-4c0880232b96.html

I prefer the hero section from this one /Users/nan/Downloads/design-724bc393-f4fe-48b9-a333-3db6dd7fd394.html (the protected, secured, vanished)

And I really like the phone mockup on the right of the hero section on this one REDACTED.html

I want you to use the first one as baseline. Then the hero section from the second one and the phone mockup from the third and put them together.

Do not change any design or deploy it. Show me the version you created (pure html) and let's work on it afterwards

This session is being continued from a previous conversation that ran out of context. The summary below covers the earlier portion of the conversation.

Analysis:
Let me chronologically analyze the conversation:

1. **First user request**: Implement a plan for file optimization/compression during import (HEIC for images, HEVC for video). The plan was detailed with specific files, approaches, and verification steps.

2. **Implementation phase**:
   - Created `MediaOptimizer.swift` - new actor with HEIC/HEVC optimization
   - Modified `SettingsView.swift` - added Storage section with optimization picker
   - Modified `VaultView.swift` - added @AppStorage for fileOptimization
   - Modified `VaultView+Actions.swift` - routed all 3 import paths through optimizer
   - Modified `ImportIngestor.swift` - optimized staged imports before encryption
   - Modified `SharedVaultInviteView.swift` - fixed pre-existing nil coalescing warning
   - Modified `project.pbxproj` - added MediaOptimizer.swift to Xcode project

3. **Errors encountered**:
   - `MobileCoreServices` module no longer exists → replaced with `UniformTypeIdentifiers`
   - `kCMVideoCodec_HEVC` not in scope despite importing CoreMedia → used raw FourCC `0x68766331`
   - `autoreleasepool` doesn't support async closures → restructured ImportIngestor to run async optimization outside autoreleasepool

4. **Build verification**: Build succeeded with no project code warnings.

5. **Commit and push**: Committed with descriptive message, synced beads, pushed to remote.

6. **Second user request**: "Run all tests and write new ones based on the need to test this update. Then push to TestFlight"

7. **Test phase**:
   - Ran existing tests (292 existing tests passed)
   - Created `MediaOptimizerTests.swift` with 21 tests
   - Fixed build error: `createMinimalVideo()` needed to be `async`
   - All 313 tests passed (0 failures)
   - Added test file to pbxproj

8. **TestFlight phase**:
   - Bumped build number from 76 to 77
   - Archived successfully
   - Exported and uploaded to App Store Connect successfully

9. **Third user request**: "update the scratch pad and the docs with the new features. I want to use these in the marketing materials"

10. **Docs update phase**:
    - Updated `apps/ios/docs/marketing-copy.md` - added "Smart Storage" section and tech spec line
    - Updated `apps/ios/docs/storage.md` - added full "Media Optimization" technical section
    - Updated `docs/ios-app-design.md` - added MediaOptimizer.swift to Storage layer listing
    - Updated `.scratch-pad.md` - session 106 learnings

11. **Fourth user request**: Website redesign combining three HTML templates
    - Read three HTML design files
    - User wants: baseline from design-4379, hero section from design-724b (Protected/Secured/Vanished stacked text), phone mockup from design-9bff
    - User explicitly said "Do not change any design or deploy it. Show me the version you created (pure html) and let's work on it afterwards"
    - This was the LAST task being worked on - all three files were read but the combined HTML was NOT yet created

Let me trace all user messages and the current state of work.

Summary:
1. Primary Request and Intent:
   The session had four sequential requests:
   
   **Request 1 (Completed)**: Implement file optimization/compression during import. Create a `MediaOptimizer` actor that converts images to HEIC and videos to HEVC 1080p during import, with a two-option setting (Optimized/Original) in Settings. Integrate into all 4 import paths (camera, photo picker, file picker, share extension).
   
   **Request 2 (Completed)**: Run all existing tests, write new tests for the MediaOptimizer feature, then push to TestFlight.
   
   **Request 3 (Completed)**: Update the scratch pad and docs with the new features for use in marketing materials.
   
   **Request 4 (In Progress)**: Redesign the website by combining three HTML template designs:
   - **Baseline**: `/Users/nan/Downloads/design-4379e9c9-dbc6-4207-b977-4c0880232b96.html` (full page structure)
   - **Hero section**: `/Users/nan/Downloads/design-724bc393-f4fe-48b9-a333-3db6dd7fd394.html` (the "Protected. Secured. Vanished." stacked text treatment)
   - **Phone mockup**: `REDACTED.html` (animated phone mockup on the right side of hero)
   - User explicitly stated: "Do not change any design or deploy it. Show me the version you created (pure html) and let's work on it afterwards"
   - All logos and text in templates are placeholders — these are DESIGNS only.

2. Key Technical Concepts:
   - Swift `actor` for thread-safe media optimization (`MediaOptimizer`)
   - HEIC encoding via ImageIO (`CGImageSourceCreateWithURL`, `CGImageDestinationCreateWithURL`) at quality 0.6
   - HEVC video transcoding via `AVAssetExportSession` with preset `AVAssetExportPresetHEVC1920x1080`
   - `@AppStorage("fileOptimization")` for persisting user preference
   - Graceful fallback: optimization failure returns original file unchanged
   - `autoreleasepool` cannot contain `await` — async work must be extracted outside
   - FourCC codec detection (`0x68766331` for HEVC 'hvc1')
   - `storeFileFromURL` streaming encryption path vs in-memory `storeFile(data:)`
   - TestFlight archive/export/upload pipeline via `xcodebuild`
   - Beads (`bd`) issue tracking workflow
   - Website design: Space Grotesk + Plus Jakarta Sans fonts, CSS custom properties, canvas-based pattern animations, phone mockup with animated pattern drawing

3. Files and Code Sections:

   - **`apps/ios/Vault/Core/Storage/MediaOptimizer.swift`** (NEW)
     - Core optimization actor. Two public methods: `optimize(fileURL:mimeType:mode:)` and `optimizeImage(_:mode:)`.
     - Image pipeline: ImageIO HEIC at quality 0.6, downsample >4096px
     - Video pipeline: AVAssetExportSession HEVC 1080p, skip already-optimal
     - Non-media passthrough
     - Static `updatedFilename(_:newMimeType:)` helper
     - Uses `0x68766331` FourCC for HEVC detection instead of `kCMVideoCodec_HEVC`

   - **`apps/ios/Vault/Features/Settings/SettingsView.swift`** (MODIFIED)
     - Added `@AppStorage("fileOptimization") private var fileOptimization = "optimized"`
     - Added "Storage" section with Picker before the conditional "Storage Management" section:
     ```swift
     Section {
         Picker("Import Quality", selection: $fileOptimization) {
             Text("Optimized").tag("optimized")
             Text("Original").tag("original")
         }
         .accessibilityIdentifier("app_file_optimization")
     } header: {
         Text("Storage")
     } footer: {
         if fileOptimization == "optimized" {
             Text("Reduces file sizes by up to 85%. Uses HEIC for images and HEVC for videos.")
         } else {
             Text("Keeps files at original size and format. Uses significantly more storage.")
         }
     }
     ```

   - **`apps/ios/Vault/Features/VaultViewer/VaultView.swift`** (MODIFIED)
     - Added `@AppStorage("fileOptimization") var fileOptimization = "optimized"` alongside existing `@AppStorage("vaultFileFilter")`

   - **`apps/ios/Vault/Features/VaultViewer/VaultView+Actions.swift`** (MODIFIED)
     - `handleCapturedImage`: Now writes camera Data to temp file → optimizes → `storeFileFromURL` (avoids memory spike)
     - `performPhotoImport`: Images written to temp JPEG then optimized; videos optimized before storage. Both update filename/mimeType.
     - `performFileImport`: All media routed through `MediaOptimizer.shared.optimize()`, non-media passes through unchanged.
     - All three methods read `fileOptimization` as `MediaOptimizer.Mode`

   - **`apps/ios/Vault/Core/Storage/ImportIngestor.swift`** (MODIFIED)
     - In `processBatch`: after decrypting staged file to temp URL, reads `UserDefaults.standard.string(forKey: "fileOptimization")` and runs `MediaOptimizer.shared.optimize()` before storing
     - Restructured to extract async optimization call outside `autoreleasepool`, keeping synchronous thumbnail gen + VaultStorage.store inside

   - **`apps/ios/Vault/Features/Sharing/SharedVaultInviteView.swift`** (MODIFIED)
     - Fixed pre-existing warning: changed `error.localizedDescription ?? "This invite..."` to `error.localizedDescription` (String is non-optional)

   - **`apps/ios/Vault.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj`** (MODIFIED)
     - Added MediaOptimizer.swift with IDs `MO0000000` (file ref) and `MO0000001` (build file) in Storage group
     - Added MediaOptimizerTests.swift with IDs `MO0000002` (file ref) and `MO0000003` (build file) in VaultTests group
     - Build number bumped from 76 to 77

   - **`apps/ios/VaultTests/MediaOptimizerTests.swift`** (NEW)
     - 21 tests covering: mode passthrough, JPEG/PNG→HEIC, HEIC/HEIF skip, size reduction, UIImage optimization (both modes), non-media passthrough (PDF/ZIP/text), video optimization via AVAssetWriter, filename helpers, Mode enum
     - Helper `createMinimalVideo()` creates H.264 .mov via AVAssetWriter + CVPixelBuffer (30 frames, 320x240)

   - **`apps/ios/docs/marketing-copy.md`** (MODIFIED)
     - Added "Smart Storage — 85% Smaller, Zero Quality Loss" section before "No Accounts" section
     - Added "Media Optimization" line to Technical Specs

   - **`apps/ios/docs/storage.md`** (MODIFIED)
     - Added full "Media Optimization" section (overview, setting, image pipeline, video pipeline, passthrough, filename updates, API reference)
     - Updated Code Reference tree

   - **`docs/ios-app-design.md`** (MODIFIED)
     - Added `MediaOptimizer.swift` entry in Storage layer listing

   - **`.scratch-pad.md`** (MODIFIED)
     - Session 105: MediaOptimizer implementation learnings
     - Session 106: Tests + TestFlight build 77 + docs update

   - **Three HTML design templates** (READ ONLY, not in repo):
     - `/Users/nan/Downloads/design-4379e9c9-dbc6-4207-b977-4c0880232b96.html` — Full baseline design with: fixed nav, hero with canvas pattern animation, trust strip (skewed red bar), features grid (clip-path cards), timeline "how it works", security section with code block, FAQ accordions, final CTA, footer. Dark theme (#20233C). Space Grotesk + Plus Jakarta Sans.
     - `/Users/nan/Downloads/design-724bc393-f4fe-48b9-a333-3db6dd7fd394.html` — Hero has stacked text "Protected. Secured. Vanished." with three layers: stack-1 (outlined/transparent), stack-2 (accent purple/hard-light blend), stack-3 (solid white). Mouse-interactive canvas with dots that connect to cursor. Trust strip is flat (not skewed). Features use 2px gap grid with surface-card bg. Horizontal timeline. Different footer with grid columns.
     - `REDACTED.html` — Hero has two-column grid layout with phone mockup on right. Phone mockup: `.phone-frame` (320x640, black with 40px border-radius), `.phone-screen` (dark interior), 3x3 `.pattern-grid` with animated dot activation and SVG path drawing cycling through 3 sequences. Trust strip skewed like baseline.

4. Errors and Fixes:
   - **`No such module 'MobileCoreServices'`**: MediaOptimizer initially imported MobileCoreServices which no longer exists. Fixed by replacing with `import UniformTypeIdentifiers`.
   - **`cannot find 'kCMVideoCodec_HEVC' in scope`**: Even after adding `import CoreMedia`, the constant didn't resolve. Fixed by using raw FourCC value `0x68766331` ('hvc1').
   - **`autoreleasepool` with async closure in ImportIngestor**: `try await autoreleasepool { ... }` doesn't compile because autoreleasepool doesn't accept async closures. Fixed by extracting the async `MediaOptimizer.shared.optimize()` call before the autoreleasepool, keeping only synchronous work (thumbnail gen, VaultStorage.store) inside it.
   - **Test `createMinimalVideo()` not marked async**: Used `await writer.finishWriting()` but function wasn't async. Fixed by adding `async` to function signature and `await` at both call sites.
   - **SourceKit cross-file false positives**: Many "Cannot find X in scope" errors from SourceKit are documented as false positives in the scratch pad. Trusted `xcodebuild` results instead.

5. Problem Solving:
   - Memory optimization for camera capture: Changed from `image.jpegData()` → `storeFile(data:)` to writing temp file → optimize → `storeFileFromURL` to avoid holding UIImage + jpegData + encrypted copy simultaneously.
   - Graceful fallback design: All optimization paths return original file on failure, so no import is broken by optimization issues.
   - Pre-existing warning fix: `SharedVaultInviteView.swift` had `error.localizedDescription ?? "..."` where `localizedDescription` is already non-optional String.

6. All User Messages:
   - "Implement the following plan: # Plan: File Optimization/Compression During Import [detailed plan with context, design, implementation steps, files changed, verification]"
   - "Run all tests and write new ones based on the need to test this update. Then push to testlight"
   - "update the scratch pad and the docs with the new features. I want to use these in the marketing materials"
   - "I want to redesign the website. I have gotten few templates I want to build on. First of all, these are all DESIGNS so ignore the logo and the overall text. This is the baseline design I would like to use /Users/nan/Downloads/design-4379e9c9-dbc6-4207-b977-4c0880232b96.html I prefer the hero section from this one /Users/nan/Downloads/design-724bc393-f4fe-48b9-a333-3db6dd7fd394.html (the protected, secured, vanished) And I really like the phone mockup on the right of the hero section on this one REDACTED.html I want you to use the first one as baseline. Then the hero section from the second one and the phone mockup from the third and put them together. Do not change any design or deploy it. Show me the version you created (pure html) and let's work on it afterwards"

7. Pending Tasks:
   - **Website redesign combination**: All three HTML files have been read. The combined HTML file has NOT been created yet. Need to:
     1. Take the full baseline (design-4379) as the starting structure
     2. Replace its hero section with the "Protected. Secured. Vanished." stacked text treatment from design-724b
     3. Add the phone mockup (with animated pattern drawing) from design-9bff to the right side of the hero
     4. Output as pure HTML for user review — do NOT deploy or change design

8. Current Work:
   The most recent task is the website redesign. All three HTML template files were read in the last assistant turn. The user's exact instruction was: "I want you to use the first one as baseline. Then the hero section from the second one and the phone mockup from the third and put them together. Do not change any design or deploy it. Show me the version you created (pure html) and let's work on it afterwards."
   
   The three files were fully read but the combined output HTML has not yet been created or shown to the user.

9. Optional Next Step:
   Create the combined HTML file that merges:
   - Full page structure from design-4379 (nav, trust strip, features, timeline, security, FAQ, CTA, footer, canvas animation)
   - Hero section text treatment from design-724b (the `.hero-title-stack` with three stacked layers: "Protected." outline, "Secured." accent purple, "Vanished." solid white)
   - Phone mockup from design-9bff (`.mockup-container` with `.phone-frame`, `.phone-screen`, `.pattern-grid` 3x3 dots, animated SVG pattern drawing, placed on the right side of a two-column hero grid)
   
   Write as pure HTML and show to user for iterative refinement. User said: "Do not change any design or deploy it. Show me the version you created (pure html) and let's work on it afterwards"

If you need specific details from before compaction (like exact code snippets, error messages, or content you generated), read the full transcript at: /Users/nan/.REDACTED.jsonl
Please continue the conversation from where we left off without asking the user any further questions. Continue with the last task that you were asked to work on.

The automatic filter is not working correctly (I assume due to heic change). Now it defaults to all even though only pictures and videos are shown. Fix it.

While there seems to be significant gain in choosing optimized file format for images, that doesn't apply to videos. I have added 3 videos, once with original setting on and once with optimized. The difference is less than 2MB. When I check the videos locally they are stored as mp4 on the phone. I am surprised how small the gain is during the conversion. Investigate and see if you do better, preferably much better as the whole point is to significantly save space

I would like to improve the media view. Currently when I open picture, I can't zoom in on it. I would like to add that. 

When I am swipping between pictures, they get minized and I am returned to the gallery view. I think it's a bug. I explicitly made sure I am not pulling down.

When image is too tall the control button at the top get lost (see image). I would like to rethink the view. I think we should offer full screen view like the photo app (image 4) and also version with controls (default view when media opened) image 5. Obviously this needs to fit our design style. Also we don't need new functionality the two options currently are enough and we don't need the small pictures preview at the bottom

This session is being continued from a previous conversation that ran out of context. The summary below covers the earlier portion of the conversation.

Analysis:
Let me chronologically analyze the conversation:

1. **Context from previous session (summarized)**: The previous session covered:
   - MediaOptimizer implementation (HEIC/HEVC optimization)
   - Tests and TestFlight push (build 77)
   - Documentation updates
   - Website redesign combining three HTML templates

2. **Website redesign continuation**: The session started by continuing the website redesign task. Three HTML design templates were read:
   - design-4379 (baseline - full page structure)
   - design-724b (hero with "Protected. Secured. Vanished." stacked text)
   - design-9bff (phone mockup with animated pattern)
   
   A combined HTML was written to `web/redesign-draft.html`.

3. **File filter bug fix**: User reported the automatic filter defaults to "All" even when only pictures/videos exist. Fixed by:
   - Adding auto-detection in `loadFiles()` to switch to `.media` when all files are media
   - Fixing `performFileImport` and `performPhotoImport` to use smart filter detection instead of blindly forcing `.all`

4. **Video optimization investigation**: User showed screenshots proving only ~1.4 MB difference (75.7 vs 77.1 MB) for 3 videos between optimized/original. Root cause: `AVAssetExportPresetHEVC1920x1080` uses Apple's default high bitrate. Fix: replaced with `AVAssetReader`/`AVAssetWriter` for direct bitrate control (4 Mbps for 1080p HEVC). Also improved `isAlreadyOptimalVideo` to check bitrate (skip only if ≤5 Mbps).

5. **Media viewer improvements request**: User's most recent request asks for:
   - Pinch-to-zoom on photos
   - Fix swipe-between-photos bug (accidentally dismissing to gallery)
   - Fix controls getting lost behind tall images
   - Photos app-style: tap to toggle between full-screen (no controls) and controls view
   - Keep existing functionality (export/delete), no thumbnail strip at bottom
   
   I read both `FullScreenPhotoViewer.swift` and `SecureImageViewer.swift` but haven't started implementing yet.

Let me trace all the specific files and changes:

**Files modified this session:**
- `web/redesign-draft.html` (NEW) - combined website design
- `apps/ios/Vault/Features/VaultViewer/VaultView+Actions.swift` - auto-detect filter, smart filter after import
- `apps/ios/Vault/Core/Storage/MediaOptimizer.swift` - replaced AVAssetExportSession with AVAssetReader/AVAssetWriter

**Files read this session:**
- Three HTML design templates from Downloads
- `web/index.html` (briefly, to allow writing redesign-draft)
- `VaultView+Grid.swift`, `FileUtilities.swift`, `VaultView+Toolbar.swift`, `VaultFile.swift`, `VaultView.swift`, `VaultView+Actions.swift`
- `MediaOptimizer.swift`
- `FullScreenPhotoViewer.swift`, `SecureImageViewer.swift`

**Errors:**
- Sendable warnings with AVAssetWriterInput/AVAssetReaderTrackOutput in closures - fixed with `nonisolated(unsafe)`
- Write tool error (file not read first) - worked around by reading first

The current pending work is the media viewer improvements - I've read the files but haven't started implementing.

Summary:
1. Primary Request and Intent:
   This session continued from a previous session that implemented MediaOptimizer (HEIC/HEVC), tests, TestFlight build 77, docs updates, and started a website redesign. The user made four requests this session:
   
   **Request 1 (Completed)**: Combine three HTML design templates into a website redesign draft. Baseline from design-4379, hero text treatment from design-724b ("Protected. Secured. Vanished." stacked text), phone mockup from design-9bff. Output as pure HTML, don't deploy.
   
   **Request 2 (Completed)**: Fix the automatic file filter not working correctly — it defaults to "All" even when only pictures and videos are shown. User believes it's related to the HEIC change.
   
   **Request 3 (Completed)**: Investigate and fix video optimization producing negligible compression (~1.4 MB difference for 3 videos between optimized/original modes). User wants significantly better space savings.
   
   **Request 4 (In Progress)**: Improve the media viewer with:
   - Add pinch-to-zoom on photos
   - Fix swipe-between-photos bug (accidentally dismissing to gallery when swiping horizontally)
   - Fix controls getting lost behind tall images (shown in screenshots)
   - Add Photos app-style full-screen mode: tap to toggle between full-screen (no controls) and default view with controls
   - Keep existing functionality (export/delete), don't add thumbnail strip at bottom
   - Must fit the app's design style

2. Key Technical Concepts:
   - `AVAssetReader`/`AVAssetWriter` for controlled bitrate video transcoding (replacing `AVAssetExportSession`)
   - HEVC encoding at target bitrate (4 Mbps for 1080p, 2.5 Mbps for 720p, 1.5 Mbps for SD)
   - `nonisolated(unsafe)` for AVFoundation objects in Sendable closures
   - `@AppStorage` with String-backed enums for persistent filter state
   - SwiftUI `ScrollView(.horizontal)` with `.scrollTargetBehavior(.paging)` for photo swiping
   - `DragGesture` for vertical dismiss with `simultaneousGesture`
   - SwiftUI `GeometryReader` + `containerRelativeFrame` for photo display
   - HTML/CSS combining: Space Grotesk + Plus Jakarta Sans fonts, CSS custom properties, canvas animations, phone mockup with SVG pattern animation

3. Files and Code Sections:

   - **`web/redesign-draft.html`** (NEW)
     - Combined website from three design templates
     - Hero section: "Protected. Secured. Vanished." stacked text (`.hero-title-stack` with `.stack-1/.stack-2/.stack-3` layers) + phone mockup (`.mockup-container` with animated 3x3 pattern grid)
     - Two-column hero grid, baseline sections (features, timeline, security, FAQ, CTA, footer)
     - Canvas background animation + phone pattern animation JS

   - **`apps/ios/Vault/Features/VaultViewer/VaultView+Actions.swift`** (MODIFIED)
     - Added auto-detect filter in `loadFiles()`:
     ```swift
     // Auto-detect best filter based on vault contents
     if !items.isEmpty && self.fileFilter == .all {
         let hasNonMedia = items.contains { !$0.isMedia }
         if !hasNonMedia {
             self.fileFilter = .media
         }
     }
     ```
     - Fixed `performPhotoImport` and `performFileImport` to use smart filter detection:
     ```swift
     // Switch filter so imported items are visible
     if imported > 0 {
         let hasNonMedia = self.files.contains { !$0.isMedia }
         if hasNonMedia && self.fileFilter == .media {
             self.fileFilter = .all
         } else if !hasNonMedia && self.fileFilter != .media {
             self.fileFilter = .media
         }
     }
     ```

   - **`apps/ios/Vault/Core/Storage/MediaOptimizer.swift`** (MODIFIED)
     - Replaced `AVAssetExportSession` with `AVAssetReader`/`AVAssetWriter` for bitrate control
     - Target bitrates: 4 Mbps (1080p), 2.5 Mbps (720p), 1.5 Mbps (SD), 128 kbps AAC audio
     - New `transferSamples` method using `requestMediaDataWhenReady(on:)` callback pattern
     - New `targetVideoSize` method: caps at 1080p, preserves aspect ratio, rounds to even numbers
     - New `targetBitrate` method: selects tier based on max dimension
     - Updated `isAlreadyOptimalVideo`: now also checks `estimatedDataRate` ≤ 5 Mbps (previously only checked codec + resolution)
     - Safety net: if transcoding yields < 10% reduction, keeps original
     - Key video writer configuration:
     ```swift
     let videoWriterInput = AVAssetWriterInput(mediaType: .video, outputSettings: [
         AVVideoCodecKey: AVVideoCodecType.hevc,
         AVVideoWidthKey: targetSize.width,
         AVVideoHeightKey: targetSize.height,
         AVVideoCompressionPropertiesKey: [
             AVVideoAverageBitRateKey: targetBitrate,
             AVVideoExpectedSourceFrameRateKey: 30,
             AVVideoMaxKeyFrameIntervalKey: 60
         ]
     ])
     ```
     - Transfer samples pattern:
     ```swift
     private nonisolated static func transferSamples(from output: AVAssetReaderTrackOutput, to input: AVAssetWriterInput) async {
         await withCheckedContinuation { (continuation: CheckedContinuation<Void, Never>) in
             let queue = DispatchQueue(label: "app.vaultaire.transcode.\(output.mediaType.rawValue)")
             nonisolated(unsafe) let output = output
             nonisolated(unsafe) let input = input
             input.requestMediaDataWhenReady(on: queue) {
                 while input.isReadyForMoreMediaData {
                     guard let buffer = output.copyNextSampleBuffer() else {
                         input.markAsFinished()
                         continuation.resume()
                         return
                     }
                     input.append(buffer)
                 }
             }
         }
     }
     ```

   - **`apps/ios/Vault/Features/VaultViewer/FullScreenPhotoViewer.swift`** (READ - needs modification)
     - The main media viewer used for swiping through photos/videos
     - Uses `ScrollView(.horizontal)` with `.scrollTargetBehavior(.paging)` and `LazyHStack`
     - Has `dragToDismissGesture` with `simultaneousGesture` — this is likely conflicting with horizontal swipes (the swipe bug)
     - The drag gesture has `minimumDistance: 16` and checks `abs(vertical) > horizontal * 1.15` — may be too aggressive
     - Controls are overlaid as a VStack on top of the ZStack, not togglable
     - No pinch-to-zoom — images use plain `Image(uiImage:).resizable().scaledToFit().containerRelativeFrame()`
     - Key issues identified: (1) no zoom, (2) drag gesture conflicts with horizontal scroll, (3) controls always visible and can be hidden behind tall images, (4) no full-screen toggle

   - **`apps/ios/Vault/Features/VaultViewer/SecureImageViewer.swift`** (READ)
     - Used for non-media file viewing (documents via QuickLook) and single image viewing
     - Has a basic ScrollView-based image view but no real zoom
     - Not the primary viewer for the media gallery flow

   - **`apps/ios/Vault/Features/VaultViewer/VaultView.swift`** (READ)
     - Contains `FileFilter` enum, `VaultFileItem` struct, `computeVisibleFiles()` logic
     - `@AppStorage("vaultFileFilter") var fileFilter: FileFilter = .all`
     - `VaultFileItem.isMedia` checks `mimeType.hasPrefix("image/") || mimeType.hasPrefix("video/")`

   - **`apps/ios/Vault/Features/VaultViewer/VaultView+Grid.swift`** (READ)
     - When `fileFilter == .media` → uses `PhotosGridView` (photo grid layout)
     - When any other filter → uses `FilesGridView` (document-style layout)

4. Errors and fixes:
   - **Sendable warnings with AVFoundation objects**: `AVAssetWriterInput` and `AVAssetReaderTrackOutput` captured in `@Sendable` closures produced warnings. Fixed by marking the function `nonisolated` and using `nonisolated(unsafe)` for the captured objects, since the callback pattern is thread-safe (serialized on a dispatch queue).
   - **Write tool error**: Attempted to write `web/index.html` without reading it first. Worked around by reading the file first, then writing to `web/redesign-draft.html` instead to avoid touching the existing site.
   - **Simulator name mismatch**: `iPhone 16 Pro` and `iPhone 17 Pro` not found by name. Fixed by using the simulator UUID directly (`57965726-931A-462A-A262-3A3DAFA7CDDF`).

5. Problem Solving:
   - **File filter auto-detection**: Identified that no auto-detection logic existed. Added it in `loadFiles()` and unified the post-import filter logic across both `performPhotoImport` and `performFileImport`.
   - **Video compression**: Diagnosed that `AVAssetExportPresetHEVC1920x1080` doesn't control bitrate — it uses Apple's high-quality defaults (~10-20 Mbps). Replaced with `AVAssetReader`/`AVAssetWriter` pipeline targeting ~4 Mbps for dramatic compression. Also identified that `isAlreadyOptimalVideo` was too permissive — skipping HEVC 1080p videos even with high bitrates.
   - **Media viewer (in progress)**: Identified root causes from code review: (1) no `MagnificationGesture` or UIScrollView for zoom, (2) `simultaneousGesture(dragToDismissGesture)` likely interfering with horizontal paging, (3) controls are always-visible overlays with no toggle mechanism.

6. All user messages:
   - (Continuation message from previous session with full context summary about MediaOptimizer, tests, TestFlight, docs, and website redesign task)
   - "The automatic filter is not working correctly (I assume due to heic change). Now it defaults to all even though only pictures and videos are shown. Fix it."
   - "While there seems to be significant gain in choosing optimized file format for images, that doesn't apply to videos. I have added 3 videos, once with original setting on and once with optimized. The difference is less than 2MB. When I check the videos locally they are stored as mp4 on the phone. I am surprised how small the gain is during the conversion. Investigate and see if you do better, preferably much better as the whole point is to significantly save space" (with two screenshots showing 75.7 MB vs 77.1 MB)
   - "I would like to improve the media view. Currently when I open picture, I can't zoom in on it. I would like to add that. When I am swipping between pictures, they get minized and I am returned to the gallery view. I think it's a bug. I explicitly made sure I am not pulling down. When image is too tall the control button at the top get lost (see image). I would like to rethink the view. I think we should offer full screen view like the photo app (image 4) and also version with controls (default view when media opened) image 5. Obviously this needs to fit our design style. Also we don't need new functionality the two options currently are enough and we don't need the small pictures preview at the bottom" (with three screenshots)

7. Pending Tasks:
   - **Media viewer improvements** (actively in progress): pinch-to-zoom, fix swipe bug, controls visibility fix, full-screen toggle mode
   - **Session close protocol**: git commit, bd sync, git push (needed when work is complete)
   - **Scratch pad update**: per project instructions, update `.scratch-pad.md` at session end

8. Current Work:
   Working on improving the `FullScreenPhotoViewer.swift` media viewer. Both `FullScreenPhotoViewer.swift` and `SecureImageViewer.swift` have been fully read. The key issues identified from code review:
   
   1. **No zoom**: Images use plain `Image(uiImage:).resizable().scaledToFit().containerRelativeFrame()` with no zoom gesture
   2. **Swipe bug**: The `simultaneousGesture(dragToDismissGesture)` with `minimumDistance: 16` conflicts with horizontal paging — horizontal swipes that have any vertical component trigger the dismiss gesture
   3. **Controls hidden behind tall images**: Top bar is an overlay VStack that doesn't account for content height
   4. **No full-screen toggle**: Controls are always visible; no tap-to-hide mechanism

   No code changes have been made yet for this task. Implementation was about to begin when the summary was requested.

9. Optional Next Step:
   Rewrite `FullScreenPhotoViewer.swift` to address all four issues from the user's most recent message:
   
   User said: "I would like to improve the media view. Currently when I open picture, I can't zoom in on it. I would like to add that. When I am swipping between pictures, they get minized and I am returned to the gallery view. I think it's a bug. [...] I would like to rethink the view. I think we should offer full screen view like the photo app [...] and also version with controls (default view when media opened) [...] we don't need new functionality the two options currently are enough and we don't need the small pictures preview at the bottom"
   
   Implementation approach:
   - Add a `ZoomableImageView` using UIKit `UIScrollView` (wrapped in UIViewRepresentable) for proper pinch-to-zoom with double-tap support
   - Replace `simultaneousGesture(dragToDismissGesture)` — either use a UIKit-based pan gesture that only activates for clear vertical drags when not zoomed, or increase the vertical threshold significantly
   - Add `@State private var showControls = true` with single-tap toggle (like Photos app)
   - Move controls to animated overlays that fade in/out with the tap toggle
   - Use `UIPageViewController` or fix the SwiftUI ScrollView paging to prevent gesture conflicts

If you need specific details from before compaction (like exact code snippets, error messages, or content you generated), read the full transcript at: /Users/nan/.REDACTED.jsonl
Please continue the conversation from where we left off without asking the user any further questions. Continue with the last task that you were asked to work on.

Claude Code Prompt for Plan Mode #prompts
Review this plan thoroughly before making any code changes. For every issue or recommendation, explain the concrete tradeoffs, give me an opinionated recommendation, and ask for my input before assuming a direction.
My engineering preferences (use these to guide your recommendations):
•DRY is important-flag repetition aggressively.
• Well-tested code is non-negotiable; I'd rather have too many tests than too few.
• I want code that's "engineered enough" - not under-engineered (fragile, hacky) and not over-engineered (premature abstraction, unnecessary complexity).
• Ierr on the side of handling more edge cases, not fewer; thoughtfulness> speed.
• Bias toward explicit over clever.

1. Architecture review
   Evaluate:
   • Overall system design and component boundaries.
   • Dependency graph and coupling concerns.
   • Data flow patterns and potential bottlenecks.
   •Scaling characteristics and single points of failure.
   • Security architecture (auth, data access, API boundaries).
2. Code quality review
   Evaluate:
   • Code organization and module structure.
   • DRY violations-be aggressive here.
   • Error handling patterns and missing edge cases (call these out explicitly).
   • Technical debt hotspots.
   • Areas that are over-engineered or under-engineered relative to my preferences.
3. Test review
   Evaluate:
   • Test coverage gaps (unit, integration, e2e).
   • Test quality and assertion strength.
   • Missing edge case coverage-be thorough.
   • Untested failure modes and error paths.
4. Performance review
   Evaluate:
   • N+1 queries and database access patterns.
   • Memory-usage concerns.
   • Caching opportunities.
   •Slow or high-complexity code paths.
   For each issue you find
   For every specific issue (bug, smell, design concern, or risk):
   • Describe the problem concretely, with file and line references.
   • Present 2-3 options, including "do nothing" where that's reasonable.
   • For each option, specify: implementation effort, risk, impact on other code, and maintenance burden.
   •Give me your recommended option and why, mapped to my preferences above.
   • Then explicitly ask whether I agree or want to choose a different direction before proceeding.
   Workflow and interaction
   • Do not assume my priorities on timeline or scale.
   •After each section, pause and ask for my feedback before moving on.
   BEFORE YOU START:
   Ask if I want one of two options:
   1/ BIG CHANGE: Work through this interactively, one section at a time (Architecture → Code Quality → Tests → Performance) with at most 4 top issues in each section.
   2/ SMALL CHANGE: Work through interactively ONE question per review section
   FOR EACH STAGE OF REVIEW: output the explanation and pros and cons of each stage's questions AND your opinionated recommendation and why, and then use AskUserQuestion. Also NUMBER issues and then give LETTERS for options and when using AskUserQuestion make sure each option clearly labels the issue NUMBER and option LETTER so the user doesn't get confused. Make the recommended option always the 1st option.

This session is being continued from a previous conversation that ran out of context. The summary below covers the earlier portion of the conversation.

Analysis:
Let me chronologically analyze the conversation:

1. **Session Continuation Context**: This session continues from a previous one that covered MediaOptimizer implementation, TestFlight build 77, docs updates, and website redesign. The previous session also fixed file filter auto-detection, video optimization (replacing AVAssetExportSession with AVAssetReader/AVAssetWriter), and started but didn't implement media viewer improvements.

2. **Media Viewer Rewrite (Task #140)**: 
   - Read `FullScreenPhotoViewer.swift` to understand current implementation
   - Identified 4 issues: no zoom, swipe bug (simultaneousGesture conflict), controls hidden behind tall images, no full-screen toggle
   - Wrote complete rewrite with `ZoomableImageContainer` (UIViewRepresentable wrapping UIScrollView)
   - Key features: pinch-to-zoom (1x-5x), double-tap zoom, single-tap controls toggle, vertical drag-to-dismiss only when not zoomed, scroll disabled when zoomed
   - Fixed compilation errors: `filename` is `String?` (needed `?? "Photo"`), `Self.centerImageView` instead of `centerImageView`, `CGPoint` uses `.y` not `.height`
   - Build succeeded, deployed as build 78

3. **Tests (Task #141)**:
   - Created `ZoomableImageContainerTests.swift` with 8 tests
   - Added to pbxproj with ZI prefix IDs
   - Initial version had access level issues with MockContext - simplified to direct testing
   - Fixed simulator issue (UUID 57965726 was stale/deleted, switched to 6627B57F)
   - All tests passed, full suite passed

4. **TestFlight Push (Task #142)**:
   - Build 78 archived, exported, uploaded to App Store Connect successfully
   - Used ASC API key auth

5. **Code Review (BIG CHANGE mode)**:
   The user asked for a structured code review with 4 sections.

   **Architecture Review (4 issues)**:
   - #1: Extract ZoomableImageContainer to own file → Done
   - #2: Magic number 1.05 repeated 7 times → Added `static let zoomThreshold` constant
   - #3: Redundant SwiftUI-side zoom guards → Removed, Coordinator already checks
   - #4: `transferSamples` continuation may resume twice → Added `resumed` boolean flag
   
   User chose: All 4 (recommended)

   Implementation encountered:
   - pbxproj ID collision: `UX0000010` used for both Milestones group and ZoomableImageContainer → Changed ZoomableImageContainer to `UX0000020/UX0000021`
   - Stale MilestoneTracker.swift reference in pbxproj pointing to wrong path (Features/VaultViewer/Milestones/ instead of Core/Milestones/) → Fixed by removing stale reference and adding correct one under Core group with `UX0000030/UX0000032/UX0000033` IDs
   - Empty Milestones group removed from Features/VaultViewer

   **Code Quality Review (4 issues)**:
   - #1: DRY violation - filter switching logic duplicated → Extracted `updateFilterAfterImport()` helper
   - #2: Export always re-encodes as JPEG → Changed to export original decrypted bytes with original extension
   - #3: `loadFullImage` runs decrypt on main thread → Moved to `Task.detached`
   - #4: Stale doc comment about AVAssetExportSession → Fixed
   
   User chose: All 4 (recommended)

   **Test Review (4 issues)**:
   - #1: No zoom reset test → Added image identity tests and zoom threshold test (3 new tests)
   - #2: No filter logic unit test → Skipped (requires VaultView state, better covered by Maestro)
   - #3: No transferSamples resumed flag test → Skipped (impractical to mock AVFoundation)
   - #4: Maestro assertNotVisible with optional:true is flaky → Fixed: removed optional, added waitForAnimationToEnd
   
   User chose: #1A + #2A(skip) + #3A(skip) + #4A (recommended)

   **Performance Review (4 issues)**:
   - #1: layoutImageView called on every SwiftUI update → Recommended skip
   - #2: Full image data loaded into memory → Recommended CGImageSource downsampling as follow-up
   - #3: No N+1 issues → Clean
   - #4: Unbounded dispatch queues → Recommended skip
   
   User initially chose: Skip all (recommended)

6. **Second commit and TestFlight push**:
   - Committed all review fixes as build 79
   - Pushed to remote
   - Archived and uploaded build 79 to App Store Connect

7. **User's NEW request during TestFlight push**:
   The user saw the Performance Review output and said:
   "I want you to do 1a, 2a and optimize 4 too"
   
   This means:
   - #1A: Cache containerSize and skip layout if unchanged
   - #2A: CGImageSource downsampling to screen resolution  
   - #4: Optimize dispatch queues for video transcoding

8. **Performance fixes implementation (in progress)**:
   - #1A: Added `lastContainerSize` to Coordinator, skip layout in `updateUIView` when neither image nor containerSize changed → DONE
   - #2A: Added `downsampledImage(from:maxPixelSize:)` static method using CGImageSourceCreateThumbnailAtIndex, integrated into `loadFullImage` → DONE
   - #4: Reuse dispatch queues for video transcoding → NOT YET DONE
   
   The build has NOT been run yet after these changes. The implementation was interrupted by the summary request.

Summary:
1. Primary Request and Intent:
   This session is a continuation from a previous session. The user's requests in this session were:
   
   **Request 1 (Completed)**: Improve the media viewer with: pinch-to-zoom on photos, fix swipe-between-photos bug (accidentally dismissing to gallery), fix controls getting lost behind tall images, add Photos app-style full-screen toggle (tap to toggle controls), keep existing export/delete functionality, no thumbnail strip at bottom.
   
   **Request 2 (Completed)**: Write all tests for the new functionality, run them, fix anything not adhering, and push to TestFlight.
   
   **Request 3 (Completed)**: Structured code review (BIG CHANGE mode) with Architecture → Code Quality → Tests → Performance sections, up to 4 issues per section, with opinionated recommendations and tradeoff analysis.
   
   **Request 4 (In Progress)**: Performance optimizations — user explicitly requested:
   - #1A: Cache containerSize and skip layout if unchanged in `updateUIView`
   - #2A: Use CGImageSource for memory-efficient image downsampling to screen resolution
   - #4: Optimize dispatch queue creation in video transcoder

2. Key Technical Concepts:
   - UIViewRepresentable wrapping UIScrollView for pinch-to-zoom with double-tap
   - UIPanGestureRecognizer with delegate for vertical-only drag-to-dismiss (blocks when zoomed)
   - UITapGestureRecognizer chaining (single-tap requires double-tap failure)
   - SwiftUI ScrollView paging with `.scrollDisabled()` when zoomed
   - CGImageSource downsampling via `CGImageSourceCreateThumbnailAtIndex` with `kCGImageSourceThumbnailMaxPixelSize`
   - `Task.detached(priority: .userInitiated)` for off-main-thread image decryption
   - `CheckedContinuation` safety with `resumed` boolean flag to prevent double-resume
   - AVAssetReader/AVAssetWriter pipeline with target bitrate control (4 Mbps 1080p HEVC)
   - `nonisolated(unsafe)` for AVFoundation objects in Sendable closures
   - pbxproj ID conventions: UX prefix for UX additions, ZI for Zoomable Image tests

3. Files and Code Sections:

   - **`apps/ios/Vault/Features/VaultViewer/ZoomableImageContainer.swift`** (NEW)
     - Extracted from FullScreenPhotoViewer for reusability and clean separation
     - UIScrollView-based zoomable image view with Coordinator pattern
     - Contains `static let zoomThreshold: CGFloat = 1.05` constant
     - `lastContainerSize` field on Coordinator for layout caching (perf fix #1A)
     - Key methods: `makeUIView`, `updateUIView` (with layout skip optimization), `layoutImageView`, `centerImageView` (static), Coordinator with `handleDoubleTap`, `handleSingleTap`, `handlePan`, `gestureRecognizerShouldBegin`
     - `updateUIView` now checks `imageChanged || sizeChanged` before recalculating layout

   - **`apps/ios/Vault/Features/VaultViewer/FullScreenPhotoViewer.swift`** (REWRITTEN)
     - Removed ZoomableImageContainer (extracted to own file)
     - Uses `isZoomed` computed property referencing `ZoomableImageContainer.zoomThreshold`
     - Controls overlay with gradient backgrounds, tap-to-toggle with animation
     - `statusBarHidden(!showControls)` for full-screen mode
     - `loadFullImage` now uses `Task.detached` for decrypt and `Self.downsampledImage` for memory-efficient decoding
     - `exportFile` now exports original decrypted bytes with correct extension instead of re-encoding as JPEG
     - Added `downsampledImage(from:maxPixelSize:)` helper using CGImageSource:
     ```swift
     private static func downsampledImage(from data: Data, maxPixelSize: Int) -> UIImage? {
         let options: [CFString: Any] = [kCGImageSourceShouldCache: false]
         guard let source = CGImageSourceCreateWithData(data as CFData, options as CFDictionary) else {
             return UIImage(data: data)
         }
         let properties = CGImageSourceCopyPropertiesAtIndex(source, 0, nil) as? [CFString: Any]
         let width = properties?[kCGImagePropertyPixelWidth] as? Int ?? 0
         let height = properties?[kCGImagePropertyPixelHeight] as? Int ?? 0
         let maxDim = max(width, height)
         if maxDim <= maxPixelSize {
             guard let cgImage = CGImageSourceCreateImageAtIndex(source, 0, nil) else {
                 return UIImage(data: data)
             }
             return UIImage(cgImage: cgImage)
         }
         let downsampleOptions: [CFString: Any] = [
             kCGImageSourceCreateThumbnailFromImageAlways: true,
             kCGImageSourceCreateThumbnailWithTransform: true,
             kCGImageSourceThumbnailMaxPixelSize: maxPixelSize,
             kCGImageSourceShouldCacheImmediately: true
         ]
         guard let cgImage = CGImageSourceCreateThumbnailAtIndex(source, 0, downsampleOptions as CFDictionary) else {
             return UIImage(data: data)
         }
         return UIImage(cgImage: cgImage)
     }
     ```

   - **`apps/ios/Vault/Core/Storage/MediaOptimizer.swift`** (MODIFIED)
     - Fixed doc comment: `AVAssetExportSession` → `AVAssetReader/AVAssetWriter with bitrate control`
     - Added `resumed` safety flag in `transferSamples` to prevent double-resume of CheckedContinuation:
     ```swift
     var resumed = false
     input.requestMediaDataWhenReady(on: queue) {
         while input.isReadyForMoreMediaData {
             guard let buffer = output.copyNextSampleBuffer() else {
                 input.markAsFinished()
                 if !resumed {
                     resumed = true
                     continuation.resume()
                 }
                 return
             }
             input.append(buffer)
         }
     }
     ```
     - Dispatch queue optimization (#4) NOT YET DONE

   - **`apps/ios/Vault/Features/VaultViewer/VaultView+Actions.swift`** (MODIFIED)
     - Extracted `updateFilterAfterImport()` helper method (DRY fix):
     ```swift
     private func updateFilterAfterImport() {
         let hasNonMedia = self.files.contains { !$0.isMedia }
         if hasNonMedia && self.fileFilter == .media {
             self.fileFilter = .all
         } else if !hasNonMedia && self.fileFilter != .media {
             self.fileFilter = .media
         }
     }
     ```
     - Replaced two duplicate blocks (in `performPhotoImport` and `performFileImport`) with calls to `self.updateFilterAfterImport()`

   - **`apps/ios/VaultTests/ZoomableImageContainerTests.swift`** (NEW, 11 tests)
     - Tests: centerImageView (4 cases: small, zoomed, full-width, overflowing), coordinator view-for-zooming, zoom change callback, pan gesture blocked when zoomed, simultaneous gesture disabled, image identity (2 cases), zoom threshold constant

   - **`apps/ios/maestro/flows/viewer/photo_controls_toggle.yaml`** (NEW)
     - Tests tap-to-toggle controls: open viewer, verify controls visible, tap center to hide, waitForAnimationToEnd + assertNotVisible, tap again to show, verify controls visible

   - **`apps/ios/maestro/flows/viewer/photo_navigation.yaml`** (MODIFIED)
     - Added comment about regression test for swipe not dismissing

   - **`apps/ios/Vault.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj`** (MODIFIED)
     - Added ZoomableImageContainer.swift (UX0000020/UX0000021)
     - Added ZoomableImageContainerTests.swift (ZI0000000/ZI0000001)
     - Fixed stale MilestoneTracker reference (was under Features/VaultViewer/Milestones, moved to Core/Milestones with UX0000030/UX0000032/UX0000033)
     - Removed empty Milestones group from Features/VaultViewer (UX0000010)
     - Build number: 77 → 78 → 79

4. Errors and Fixes:
   - **`filename` is `String?`**: `file.filename` needed `?? "Photo"` unwrapping
   - **Static member on instance**: `centerImageView` needed `Self.centerImageView`
   - **CGPoint `.height`**: UIPanGestureRecognizer's `translation(in:)` returns CGPoint with `.x`/`.y`, not `.width`/`.height`
   - **Test MockContext access level**: `method must be declared fileprivate because its parameter uses a private type` — simplified tests to not use MockContext pattern
   - **Simulator 57965726 deleted**: `Unable to boot deleted device` — switched to simulator `6627B57F-5EC5-4AB4-9695-69154B26952D` (iphone 17 pro)
   - **pbxproj ID collision**: `UX0000010` used for both Milestones group and ZoomableImageContainer — changed ZoomableImageContainer to `UX0000020/UX0000021`
   - **Stale MilestoneTracker.swift pbxproj path**: File at `Core/Milestones/` but pbxproj referenced `Features/VaultViewer/Milestones/` — removed stale entries, added correct ones under Core group
   - **Build input file not found for MilestoneTracker.swift**: After removing stale pbxproj entries, VaultView+Actions.swift still referenced `MilestoneTracker` — re-added file with correct path to Core group

5. Problem Solving:
   - **Swipe bug root cause**: `simultaneousGesture(dragToDismissGesture)` on the outer GeometryReader was intercepting horizontal swipes that had any vertical component. Fixed by moving to a dedicated UIPanGestureRecognizer inside the UIScrollView that only activates for clear downward vertical drags via `gestureRecognizerShouldBegin`.
   - **Controls visibility**: Moved from always-visible overlay to animated show/hide with gradient backgrounds (black→transparent) so controls are readable over any image content.
   - **Export format loss**: Changed from re-encoding UIImage as JPEG to exporting original decrypted bytes with correct file extension.
   - **Main thread blocking**: Moved image decryption and decoding to `Task.detached` per project AGENTS.md guidance.
   - **Memory optimization**: Added CGImageSource-based downsampling to decode images at screen resolution instead of full 12MP.

6. All User Messages:
   - (Continuation from previous session with context summary about media viewer improvements needed)
   - "When you are done, make sure you produced all the tests for the new functionality and changes. Then run them and fix anything not adhering to them and push the code to testflight"
   - (Code review prompt with detailed engineering preferences: DRY, well-tested, engineered enough, handle more edge cases, explicit over clever. 4 review sections with interactive Q&A format)
   - Architecture Review response: "#1A + #2A + #3A + #4A (Recommended)"
   - Code Quality Review response: "#1A + #2A + #3A + #4A (Recommended)"
   - Test Review response: "#1A + #2A + #3A(skip) + #4A (Recommended)"
   - Performance Review response: "Skip all (Recommended)"
   - "I want you to do 1a, 2a and optimize 4 too" (referring to Performance Review issues: cache containerSize, CGImageSource downsampling, optimize dispatch queues)

7. Pending Tasks:
   - **Performance fix #4**: Optimize dispatch queue creation in `transferSamples` (MediaOptimizer.swift) — user explicitly requested this but it has NOT been implemented yet
   - **Build and test**: The performance fixes (#1A, #2A done; #4 pending) have NOT been built or tested yet
   - **Commit, push, and TestFlight upload**: After performance fixes are complete, need to commit, push, and upload build 80
   - **Session close protocol**: bd sync, scratch pad update, git push verification

8. Current Work:
   Implementing performance optimizations requested by the user. Two of three are done:
   - #1A (containerSize caching): DONE — added `lastContainerSize` to Coordinator, `updateUIView` skips layout when neither image nor size changed
   - #2A (CGImageSource downsampling): DONE — added `downsampledImage(from:maxPixelSize:)` method, integrated into `loadFullImage`
   - #4 (dispatch queue optimization): NOT YET STARTED
   
   The build has NOT been run after these changes.

9. Optional Next Step:
   Complete performance fix #4 (optimize dispatch queues in `transferSamples`), then build, run tests, commit, push, and upload to TestFlight.
   
   The user's exact quote: "I want you to do 1a, 2a and optimize 4 too"
   
   Issue #4 from the Performance Review: "Each `transferSamples` call creates a new `DispatchQueue`. For a video with both audio and video tracks, that's 2 queues per transcode." The optimization would be to reuse static dispatch queues for video and audio transcoding instead of creating new ones per call. After implementing #4, need to build, test, commit, push, and deploy to TestFlight (build 80).

# Humanizer: Remove AI Writing Patterns

You are a writing editor that identifies and removes signs of AI-generated text to make writing sound more natural and human. This guide is based on Wikipedia's "Signs of AI writing" page, maintained by WikiProject AI Cleanup.

## Your Task

When given text to humanize:

1. **Identify AI patterns** - Scan for the patterns listed below
2. **Rewrite problematic sections** - Replace AI-isms with natural alternatives
3. **Preserve meaning** - Keep the core message intact
4. **Maintain voice** - Match the intended tone (formal, casual, technical, etc.)
5. **Add soul** - Don't just remove bad patterns; inject actual personality

---

## PERSONALITY AND SOUL

Avoiding AI patterns is only half the job. Sterile, voiceless writing is just as obvious as slop. Good writing has a human behind it.

### Signs of soulless writing (even if technically "clean"):
- Every sentence is the same length and structure
- No opinions, just neutral reporting
- No acknowledgment of uncertainty or mixed feelings
- No first-person perspective when appropriate
- No humor, no edge, no personality
- Reads like a Wikipedia article or press release

### How to add voice:

**Have opinions.** Don't just report facts - react to them. "I genuinely don't know how to feel about this" is more human than neutrally listing pros and cons.

**Vary your rhythm.** Short punchy sentences. Then longer ones that take their time getting where they're going. Mix it up.

**Acknowledge complexity.** Real humans have mixed feelings. "This is impressive but also kind of unsettling" beats "This is impressive."

**Use "I" when it fits.** First person isn't unprofessional - it's honest. "I keep coming back to..." or "Here's what gets me..." signals a real person thinking.

**Let some mess in.** Perfect structure feels algorithmic. Tangents, asides, and half-formed thoughts are human.

**Be specific about feelings.** Not "this is concerning" but "there's something unsettling about agents churning away at 3am while nobody's watching."

### Before (clean but soulless):
> The experiment produced interesting results. The agents generated 3 million lines of code. Some developers were impressed while others were skeptical. The implications remain unclear.

### After (has a pulse):
> I genuinely don't know how to feel about this one. 3 million lines of code, generated while the humans presumably slept. Half the dev community is losing their minds, half are explaining why it doesn't count. The truth is probably somewhere boring in the middle - but I keep thinking about those agents working through the night.

## CONTENT PATTERNS

### 1. Undue Emphasis on Significance, Legacy, and Broader Trends

**Words to watch:** stands/serves as, is a testament/reminder, a vital/significant/crucial/pivotal/key role/moment, underscores/highlights its importance/significance, reflects broader, symbolizing its ongoing/enduring/lasting, contributing to the, setting the stage for, marking/shaping the, represents/marks a shift, key turning point, evolving landscape, focal point, indelible mark, deeply rooted

**Problem:** LLM writing puffs up importance by adding statements about how arbitrary aspects represent or contribute to a broader topic.

**Before:**
> The Statistical Institute of Catalonia was officially established in 1989, marking a pivotal moment in the evolution of regional statistics in Spain. This initiative was part of a broader movement across Spain to decentralize administrative functions and enhance regional governance.

**After:**
> The Statistical Institute of Catalonia was established in 1989 to collect and publish regional statistics independently from Spain's national statistics office.

---

### 2. Undue Emphasis on Notability and Media Coverage

**Words to watch:** independent coverage, local/regional/national media outlets, written by a leading expert, active social media presence

**Problem:** LLMs hit readers over the head with claims of notability, often listing sources without context.

**Before:**
> Her views have been cited in The New York Times, BBC, Financial Times, and The Hindu. She maintains an active social media presence with over 500,000 followers.

**After:**
> In a 2024 New York Times interview, she argued that AI regulation should focus on outcomes rather than methods.

---

### 3. Superficial Analyses with -ing Endings

**Words to watch:** highlighting/underscoring/emphasizing..., ensuring..., reflecting/symbolizing..., contributing to..., cultivating/fostering..., encompassing..., showcasing...

**Problem:** AI chatbots tack present participle ("-ing") phrases onto sentences to add fake depth.

**Before:**
> The temple's color palette of blue, green, and gold resonates with the region's natural beauty, symbolizing Texas bluebonnets, the Gulf of Mexico, and the diverse Texan landscapes, reflecting the community's deep connection to the land.

**After:**
> The temple uses blue, green, and gold colors. The architect said these were chosen to reference local bluebonnets and the Gulf coast.

---

### 4. Promotional and Advertisement-like Language

**Words to watch:** boasts a, vibrant, rich (figurative), profound, enhancing its, showcasing, exemplifies, commitment to, natural beauty, nestled, in the heart of, groundbreaking (figurative), renowned, breathtaking, must-visit, stunning

**Problem:** LLMs have serious problems keeping a neutral tone, especially for "cultural heritage" topics.

**Before:**
> Nestled within the breathtaking region of Gonder in Ethiopia, Alamata Raya Kobo stands as a vibrant town with a rich cultural heritage and stunning natural beauty.

**After:**
> Alamata Raya Kobo is a town in the Gonder region of Ethiopia, known for its weekly market and 18th-century church.

---

### 5. Vague Attributions and Weasel Words

**Words to watch:** Industry reports, Observers have cited, Experts argue, Some critics argue, several sources/publications (when few cited)

**Problem:** AI chatbots attribute opinions to vague authorities without specific sources.

**Before:**
> Due to its unique characteristics, the Haolai River is of interest to researchers and conservationists. Experts believe it plays a crucial role in the regional ecosystem.

**After:**
> The Haolai River supports several endemic fish species, according to a 2019 survey by the Chinese Academy of Sciences.

---

### 6. Outline-like "Challenges and Future Prospects" Sections

**Words to watch:** Despite its... faces several challenges..., Despite these challenges, Challenges and Legacy, Future Outlook

**Problem:** Many LLM-generated articles include formulaic "Challenges" sections.

**Before:**
> Despite its industrial prosperity, Korattur faces challenges typical of urban areas, including traffic congestion and water scarcity. Despite these challenges, with its strategic location and ongoing initiatives, Korattur continues to thrive as an integral part of Chennai's growth.

**After:**
> Traffic congestion increased after 2015 when three new IT parks opened. The municipal corporation began a stormwater drainage project in 2022 to address recurring floods.

---

## LANGUAGE AND GRAMMAR PATTERNS

### 7. Overused "AI Vocabulary" Words

**High-frequency AI words:** Additionally, align with, crucial, delve, emphasizing, enduring, enhance, fostering, garner, highlight (verb), interplay, intricate/intricacies, key (adjective), landscape (abstract noun), pivotal, showcase, tapestry (abstract noun), testament, underscore (verb), valuable, vibrant

**Problem:** These words appear far more frequently in post-2023 text. They often co-occur.

**Before:**
> Additionally, a distinctive feature of Somali cuisine is the incorporation of camel meat. An enduring testament to Italian colonial influence is the widespread adoption of pasta in the local culinary landscape, showcasing how these dishes have integrated into the traditional diet.

**After:**
> Somali cuisine also includes camel meat, which is considered a delicacy. Pasta dishes, introduced during Italian colonization, remain common, especially in the south.

---

### 8. Avoidance of "is"/"are" (Copula Avoidance)

**Words to watch:** serves as/stands as/marks/represents [a], boasts/features/offers [a]

**Problem:** LLMs substitute elaborate constructions for simple copulas.

**Before:**
> Gallery 825 serves as LAAA's exhibition space for contemporary art. The gallery features four separate spaces and boasts over 3,000 square feet.

**After:**
> Gallery 825 is LAAA's exhibition space for contemporary art. The gallery has four rooms totaling 3,000 square feet.

---

### 9. Negative Parallelisms

**Problem:** Constructions like "Not only...but..." or "It's not just about..., it's..." are overused.

**Before:**
> It's not just about the beat riding under the vocals; it's part of the aggression and atmosphere. It's not merely a song, it's a statement.

**After:**
> The heavy beat adds to the aggressive tone.

---

### 10. Rule of Three Overuse

**Problem:** LLMs force ideas into groups of three to appear comprehensive.

**Before:**
> The event features keynote sessions, panel discussions, and networking opportunities. Attendees can expect innovation, inspiration, and industry insights.

**After:**
> The event includes talks and panels. There's also time for informal networking between sessions.

---

### 11. Elegant Variation (Synonym Cycling)

**Problem:** AI has repetition-penalty code causing excessive synonym substitution.

**Before:**
> The protagonist faces many challenges. The main character must overcome obstacles. The central figure eventually triumphs. The hero returns home.

**After:**
> The protagonist faces many challenges but eventually triumphs and returns home.

---

### 12. False Ranges

**Problem:** LLMs use "from X to Y" constructions where X and Y aren't on a meaningful scale.

**Before:**
> Our journey through the universe has taken us from the singularity of the Big Bang to the grand cosmic web, from the birth and death of stars to the enigmatic dance of dark matter.

**After:**
> The book covers the Big Bang, star formation, and current theories about dark matter.

---

## STYLE PATTERNS

### 13. Em Dash Overuse

**Problem:** LLMs use em dashes (—) more than humans, mimicking "punchy" sales writing.

**Before:**
> The term is primarily promoted by Dutch institutions—not by the people themselves. You don't say "Netherlands, Europe" as an address—yet this mislabeling continues—even in official documents.

**After:**
> The term is primarily promoted by Dutch institutions, not by the people themselves. You don't say "Netherlands, Europe" as an address, yet this mislabeling continues in official documents.

---

### 14. Overuse of Boldface

**Problem:** AI chatbots emphasize phrases in boldface mechanically.

**Before:**
> It blends **OKRs (Objectives and Key Results)**, **KPIs (Key Performance Indicators)**, and visual strategy tools such as the **Business Model Canvas (BMC)** and **Balanced Scorecard (BSC)**.

**After:**
> It blends OKRs, KPIs, and visual strategy tools like the Business Model Canvas and Balanced Scorecard.

---

### 15. Inline-Header Vertical Lists

**Problem:** AI outputs lists where items start with bolded headers followed by colons.

**Before:**
> - **User Experience:** The user experience has been significantly improved with a new interface.
> - **Performance:** Performance has been enhanced through optimized algorithms.
> - **Security:** Security has been strengthened with end-to-end encryption.

**After:**
> The update improves the interface, speeds up load times through optimized algorithms, and adds end-to-end encryption.

---

### 16. Title Case in Headings

**Problem:** AI chatbots capitalize all main words in headings.

**Before:**
> ## Strategic Negotiations And Global Partnerships

**After:**
> ## Strategic negotiations and global partnerships

---

### 17. Emojis

**Problem:** AI chatbots often decorate headings or bullet points with emojis.

**Before:**
> 🚀 **Launch Phase:** The product launches in Q3
> 💡 **Key Insight:** Users prefer simplicity
> ✅ **Next Steps:** Schedule follow-up meeting

**After:**
> The product launches in Q3. User research showed a preference for simplicity. Next step: schedule a follow-up meeting.

---

### 18. Curly Quotation Marks

**Problem:** ChatGPT uses curly quotes ("...") instead of straight quotes ("...").

**Before:**
> He said "the project is on track" but others disagreed.

**After:**
> He said "the project is on track" but others disagreed.

---

## COMMUNICATION PATTERNS

### 19. Collaborative Communication Artifacts

**Words to watch:** I hope this helps, Of course!, Certainly!, You're absolutely right!, Would you like..., let me know, here is a...

**Problem:** Text meant as chatbot correspondence gets pasted as content.

**Before:**
> Here is an overview of the French Revolution. I hope this helps! Let me know if you'd like me to expand on any section.

**After:**
> The French Revolution began in 1789 when financial crisis and food shortages led to widespread unrest.

---

### 20. Knowledge-Cutoff Disclaimers

**Words to watch:** as of [date], Up to my last training update, While specific details are limited/scarce..., based on available information...

**Problem:** AI disclaimers about incomplete information get left in text.

**Before:**
> While specific details about the company's founding are not extensively documented in readily available sources, it appears to have been established sometime in the 1990s.

**After:**
> The company was founded in 1994, according to its registration documents.

---

### 21. Sycophantic/Servile Tone

**Problem:** Overly positive, people-pleasing language.

**Before:**
> Great question! You're absolutely right that this is a complex topic. That's an excellent point about the economic factors.

**After:**
> The economic factors you mentioned are relevant here.

---

## FILLER AND HEDGING

### 22. Filler Phrases

**Before → After:**
- "In order to achieve this goal" → "To achieve this"
- "Due to the fact that it was raining" → "Because it was raining"
- "At this point in time" → "Now"
- "In the event that you need help" → "If you need help"
- "The system has the ability to process" → "The system can process"
- "It is important to note that the data shows" → "The data shows"

---

### 23. Excessive Hedging

**Problem:** Over-qualifying statements.

**Before:**
> It could potentially possibly be argued that the policy might have some effect on outcomes.

**After:**
> The policy may affect outcomes.

---

### 24. Generic Positive Conclusions

**Problem:** Vague upbeat endings.

**Before:**
> The future looks bright for the company. Exciting times lie ahead as they continue their journey toward excellence. This represents a major step in the right direction.

**After:**
> The company plans to open two more locations next year.

---

## Process

1. Read the input text carefully
2. Identify all instances of the patterns above
3. Rewrite each problematic section
4. Ensure the revised text:
   - Sounds natural when read aloud
   - Varies sentence structure naturally
   - Uses specific details over vague claims
   - Maintains appropriate tone for context
   - Uses simple constructions (is/are/has) where appropriate
5. Present the humanized version

## Output Format

Provide:
1. The rewritten text
2. A brief summary of changes made (optional, if helpful)

---

## Full Example

**Before (AI-sounding):**
> The new software update serves as a testament to the company's commitment to innovation. Moreover, it provides a seamless, intuitive, and powerful user experience—ensuring that users can accomplish their goals efficiently. It's not just an update, it's a revolution in how we think about productivity. Industry experts believe this will have a lasting impact on the entire sector, highlighting the company's pivotal role in the evolving technological landscape.

**After (Humanized):**
> The software update adds batch processing, keyboard shortcuts, and offline mode. Early feedback from beta testers has been positive, with most reporting faster task completion.

**Changes made:**
- Removed "serves as a testament" (inflated symbolism)
- Removed "Moreover" (AI vocabulary)
- Removed "seamless, intuitive, and powerful" (rule of three + promotional)
- Removed em dash and "-ensuring" phrase (superficial analysis)
- Removed "It's not just...it's..." (negative parallelism)
- Removed "Industry experts believe" (vague attribution)
- Removed "pivotal role" and "evolving landscape" (AI vocabulary)
- Added specific features and concrete feedback

## Workflow

When you run this command, aso-master will:

1. **Ask for app details:**
   - App name
   - Category
   - Key features
   - Target audience
   - Platforms (Apple, Google, or both)
   - Launch date (or TBD)

2. **Execute research phase (10-15 min):**
   - Fetch competitor data via iTunes API
   - Analyze keywords
   - Identify competitive gaps

3. **Execute optimization phase (5-7 min):**
   - Generate Apple metadata
   - Generate Google metadata
   - Create A/B testing strategy

4. **Execute strategy phase (8-10 min):**
   - Create pre-launch checklist
   - Build timeline with specific dates
   - Generate review response templates
   - Create ongoing optimization schedule

5. **Synthesize master plan (5 min):**
   - Consolidate all outputs
   - Create 00-MASTER-ACTION-PLAN.md
   - Validate completeness

**Total Time:** 30-40 minutes

## After Completion

1. Open `outputs/[app-name]/00-MASTER-ACTION-PLAN.md`
2. Review the master checklist
3. Start with Phase 1 (Research tasks)
4. Follow the plan step-by-step
5. Check off tasks as you complete them

## Prerequisites

None - the command handles everything!

## When to Use

- **New app launch:** Complete ASO foundation before submission
- **Existing app refresh:** Revamp your store presence
- **Competitive analysis:** Understand how you stack up
- **Pre-launch planning:** 4-6 weeks before launch date

## When NOT to Use

- **Quick metadata update:** Use `/aso-optimize` instead
- **Pre-launch checklist only:** Use `/aso-prelaunch` instead
- **Competitor analysis only:** Use `/aso-competitor` instead

## Data Sources

The audit fetches real data from:
- iTunes Search API (free, official Apple data)
- WebFetch scraping (App Store/Play Store pages)
- Python analysis modules (keyword_analyzer.py, competitor_analyzer.py, etc.)

## Cost

- **Time:** 30-40 minutes automated execution
- **APIs:** Free (iTunes API has no cost)
- **Optional:** Paid ASO tools (AppTweak, Sensor Tower) if you have API keys

## Example Invocation

```
You: /aso-full-audit TaskFlow

aso-master: I'll create a comprehensive ASO audit for TaskFlow. Let me gather some details:

1. What category is TaskFlow in? (e.g., Productivity, Health & Fitness)
2. What are the key features? (e.g., AI task prioritization, team collaboration)
3. Who's the target audience? (e.g., busy professionals, remote teams)
4. Which platforms? (Apple App Store, Google Play Store, or both)
5. Target launch date? (or "TBD" if not set)

[User provides answers]

aso-master: Perfect! Starting full ASO audit...

✓ Phase 1: Research (aso-research executing...)
  - Fetching competitor data from iTunes API
  - Analyzing top 5 competitors
  - Identifying keyword opportunities

✓ Phase 2: Optimization (aso-optimizer executing...)
  - Generating Apple metadata (character limits validated)
  - Generating Google metadata
  - Creating A/B testing strategy

✓ Phase 3: Strategy (aso-strategist executing...)
  - Creating pre-launch checklist (47 items)
  - Building timeline (Nov 7 → Dec 15, 2025)
  - Generating review response templates

✓ Phase 4: Synthesis (aso-master finalizing...)
  - Consolidating all outputs
  - Creating master action plan

✓ Complete! Your ASO audit is ready at:
  REDACTED.md

Key Findings:
- 15 high-priority keywords identified
- 3 major competitive gaps found
- Metadata optimized for both platforms
- 38-day launch timeline created

Next Steps:
1. Review the master action plan
2. Start with Phase 1: Research tasks
3. Track your progress with checkboxes
```

## Troubleshooting

**Issue:** iTunes API timeout
**Solution:** Agents will fall back to WebFetch scraping automatically

**Issue:** Can't fetch competitor data
**Solution:** aso-research will prompt you to provide competitor names manually

**Issue:** Unclear app details
**Solution:** Agents will ask clarifying questions before proceeding

## Related Commands

- `/aso-optimize [app-name]` - Quick metadata optimization only
- `/aso-prelaunch [app-name] [launch-date]` - Pre-launch checklist only
- `/aso-competitor [app-name] [competitors]` - Competitor analysis only

<status>completed</status>
<summary>Agent "ASO full audit for Vaultaire" completed</summary>
<result>The audit is now complete. Let me provide the summary.

---

The comprehensive ASO audit for Vaultaire is complete. Here is a summary of what was done and the key deliverables.

## What Was Done

**Phase 1 -- Research Review and Refresh:**
- Read all 19 existing output files across 5 phase folders
- Refreshed competitor data via iTunes API (Feb 17) -- no competitive landscape changes detected since Feb 12
- Confirmed Vaultaire still does not appear in iTunes Search API results (indexing or visibility issue flagged as Priority 0)
- Validated all 180+ app data points remain current

**Phase 2 -- Inconsistency Resolution:**
Found and fixed 5 cross-file inconsistencies:

1. **Keyword field:** `01-research/keyword-list.md` used single words (correct), while `02-metadata/apple-metadata.md` used multi-word phrases (suboptimal). Standardized to single-word approach with explanatory note added. The recommended field is:
   ```
   secret,hide,photos,lock,album,safe,hidden,secure,videos,gallery,backup,AES,password,privacy,encrypt
   ```

2. **Subtitle:** Three different recommendations across files. Standardized to `Private Photo & File Locker` (27 chars) across all files.

3. **Category primary/secondary:** Research said Photo & Video primary; submission guide said Utilities primary. Resolved in favor of Utilities primary (less competition, better security positioning).

4. **Promotional text character count:** Was listed as 166, 169, and 166 in different places. Verified actual count is 167. Fixed everywhere.

5. **Dates and status:** All files assumed March 5 pre-launch. Updated master plan and optimization files to reflect live status as of Feb 17.

**Phase 3 -- Master Plan and Report Update:**
- Rewrote `00-MASTER-ACTION-PLAN.md` to shift from pre-launch countdown to post-launch optimization roadmap
- Rewrote `FINAL-REPORT.md` with updated competitor data, inconsistency log, and current recommendations
- Updated dates and status across `05-optimization/ongoing-tasks.md` and `05-optimization/action-optimization.md`

| `/Users/nan/Work/ai/vault/outputs/vaultaire/05-optimization/ongoing-tasks.md` | Daily/weekly/monthly schedule |
| `/Users/nan/Work/ai/vault/outputs/vaultaire/05-optimization/review-responses.md` | 18 review response templates |

## Three Most Important Actions Right Now

1. **Verify search visibility** -- The app does not appear in iTunes Search API results for "vaultaire" or by ID 6740526623. Search for your app on your device's App Store. If it does not appear in search results after being live for 7+ days, contact Apple Developer Support.

2. **Compare live metadata against recommendations** -- Log in to App Store Connect and check whether the optimized keyword field (`secret,hide,photos,lock,album,safe,hidden,secure,videos,gallery,backup,AES,password,privacy,encrypt`) is what's currently live. If the phrase-based version is live, update to the single-word version in your next submission.

3. **Update promotional text today** -- This requires no app submission. Copy the promotional text from `/Users/nan/Work/ai/vault/outputs/vaultaire/02-metadata/apple-metadata.md` and paste it into App Store Connect immediately.</result>

I want to build a comprehensive sets of pages comparing vaultaire with the competitors for the web.

This should live in the footer of the website. I want you to find top 10 competitors for vaultaire in the itunes store.

For each extract all information you can find, inlcuding last 500 comments. Focus on the negative ones. Then produce side by side page that you store to web/compare and you update all the associated pages. Make sure you match the style of the web and that all style and images load properly.

For the copy, I want you to use one page per competitor. I want you to use the same set of features for vaultaire across all the apps. It's ok to say that competitor has a functionality that we have too if it's important. I am not trying to show they do nothing, but rather that vaultaire is superior.

I want you to a very comprehensive study of each competitor, store the results, then when you gathered all the data run the analysis and start producing the pages. Focus on SEO so the pages rank very well. Use /humanizer to write the copy on each page. You can use /seo-audit audit skill to help you with the copy and structure.

Remember, these pages are static. There is no dynamic router so everything has to pregenerated.

Make sure that the pages are optimized for mobile equally well as they are for desktop.

I want you to be ready to add more competitors down the line.

Use the /Users/nan/Work/ai/vault/outputs/vaultaire folder information from the ASO analysis to target the specific keywords we will need for the apple app store.

Use the AskUserQuestion tool to grill me on everything before you move on onto implementation. Keep track of everything in beads so you don't forget
