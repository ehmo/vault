Implement the following plan:

# Plan: Competitor Comparison Pages for Vaultaire Website

## Context

Build 21 static HTML pages comparing Vaultaire against the top 10 photo vault competitors on the App Store. Pages live at `web/compare/` and serve dual purpose: SEO (rank for "[competitor] alternative" and "vaultaire vs [competitor]" queries) and conversion (show Vaultaire's encryption advantage over competitors that mostly use PIN screens over unencrypted files).

## The 10 competitors

outputs/vaultaire/competitors/
├── private-photo-vault.json                # Scraped data + review themes
├── keepsafe.json

```

Total: 1 CSS + 1 index + 10 comparison pages + 10 review articles = 22 new files + 10 data JSONs. 5 existing pages get footer updates.

## Phase 1: Data collection

For each of the 10 competitors:
1. Fetch current metadata from iTunes lookup API (`itunes.apple.com/lookup?id=APPID`) — includes `price` and `formattedPrice`
2. Scrape App Store web page for reviews (focus on 1-3 star negative reviews)
3. Scrape App Store page for in-app purchase pricing (subscription tiers, lifetime options)
4. Analyze competitor description to fill 17-feature boolean table
5. Identify top 3-5 complaint themes from negative reviews
6. Write positioning statement and Vaultaire response for each complaint
7. Document pricing: free tier limits, subscription prices, what's locked behind paywall

Store as JSON in `outputs/vaultaire/competitors/[slug].json`. Reuse existing data from `outputs/vaultaire/01-research/raw-data/` where available.

## Phase 2: Infrastructure

### `web/compare/styles.css` (shared)

Extract CSS from existing inner pages (manifesto/privacy pattern). Contains:
- CSS variables (`--bg`, `--surface`, `--text`, `--accent`, `--highlight`) with dark/light theme
- Header/nav (glassmorphism, logo toggle, nav-links)
- Footer (existing links + new compare links row)
- Compare-specific: `.compare-hero`, `.compare-table`, `.compare-section`, `.compare-reviews`, `.compare-cta`, `.compare-card`, `.breadcrumbs`, `.review-article`
- Responsive at 900px and 768px breakpoints
- Angular/beveled aesthetic matching main site (clip-path buttons, Space Grotesk headings, Plus Jakarta Sans body)

### `web/compare/index.html` (compare landing)

Grid of 10 competitor cards. Each card: hotlinked icon, "Vaultaire vs X" heading, rating count, one-line differentiator. Links to comparison page.

SEO: title "Vaultaire vs Competitors | Photo Vault Comparison", Schema.org ItemList.

### Footer updates (5 existing pages)

Add to all pages:
1. "Compare" link in main footer-links row
2. New `footer-compare` row with all 10 competitor page links (for SEO internal linking)
3. Small inline CSS addition for `footer-compare` styling (since existing pages use inline CSS)

Pages: `index.html`, `manifesto/index.html`, `privacy/index.html`, `terms/index.html`, `s/index.html`

Path prefixes: root pages use `compare/...`, sub-pages use `../compare/...`

## Phase 3: Comparison pages (10 pages)

URL: `web/compare/vaultaire-vs-[slug]/index.html`

Each page structure:
1. Breadcrumbs: Home / Compare / vs [Competitor]
2. Hero: competitor icon (hotlinked Apple CDN), "Vaultaire vs [Competitor]" h1, positioning statement
3. Feature table: 17 rows, Vaultaire vs Competitor columns, checkmarks + notes
4. Pricing comparison: side-by-side tiers showing what each tier includes, Vaultaire vs competitor
5. 3-4 deep-dive sections (encryption, duress, privacy, user complaints)
6. "What users say" section (scraped review complaints + how Vaultaire addresses them)
7. CTA: Download Vaultaire
8. Link to full review article
9. "More comparisons" nav linking to other 9 pages

SEO per page: unique title/description, canonical URL, og: tags, Schema.org SoftwareApplication, keywords from ASO research.

### 17-feature comparison table (consistent across all pages)

1. AES-256-GCM encryption
2. Secure Enclave hardware keys
3. Pattern lock (not PIN)
4. Multiple independent vaults
5. Duress vault (destroy on trigger)
6. Zero-knowledge architecture (no accounts)
7. Encrypted iCloud backup
8. Encrypted vault sharing
9. Recovery phrase
10. No biometrics (by design)
11. Photos, Videos & Files support
12. Media optimization (HEIC/HEVC)
13. Free tier available
14. No ads in free tier
15. Share sheet import
16. Camera capture
17. Offline-only by default

### Pricing comparison section (on each page, below feature table)

Side-by-side pricing breakdown. Vaultaire pricing:
- **Free**: 1 vault, 100 files, pattern lock, AES-256 encryption, camera/photo import
- **Pro Monthly**: $1.99/mo — unlimited vaults, unlimited files, duress vault, iCloud backup, vault sharing
- **Pro Annual**: $9.99/yr — same as monthly, 58% savings
- **Pro Lifetime**: $29.99 one-time — all Pro features forever

For each competitor, show their equivalent tiers and what's included/excluded. Highlight where Vaultaire's free tier includes features competitors lock behind paywalls (e.g., real encryption in the free tier). Also highlight where Vaultaire's paid tier is cheaper for equivalent features.

## Phase 4: Review articles (10 pages)

URL: `web/compare/vaultaire-vs-[slug]/review/index.html`

Long-form blog-post style. Structure:
1. "[Competitor] Review: Is It Worth It in 2026?" h1
2. Overview of competitor
3. Feature-by-feature analysis with Vaultaire comparison
4. Pricing analysis
5. User complaints deep-dive (expanded, with quotes from scraped reviews)
6. How Vaultaire addresses each pain point
7. Verdict + CTA

SEO targets: "[competitor] alternative", "[competitor] review 2026", "is [competitor] safe"

All copy run through /humanizer skill.

## Phase 5: SEO audit + polish

- Verify all internal links work (no broken hrefs)
- Verify canonical URLs, og: tags, meta descriptions are unique per page
- Check Schema.org JSON-LD validity
- Test mobile rendering at 375px, 768px, 1024px
- Verify theme toggle on all new pages
- Verify breadcrumbs link correctly
- Check all competitor icon URLs load

## Design decisions

- **Shared CSS** (new pattern): compare pages use `<link href="../styles.css">` instead of inline styles. Existing pages keep inline CSS unchanged.
- **Competitor icons**: hotlink from Apple CDN (`is1-ssl.mzstatic.com`). No local hosting. Avoids trademark issues.
- **No templating engine**: pages are hand-written static HTML (matches existing site). Trade-off: more repetition, but no build complexity.
- **Relative paths**: compare/index.html uses `../` for root, comparison pages use `../../`, review pages use `../../../`

## Verification

1. All 22 new pages render correctly in browser (dark + light theme)
2. Mobile layout works at 375px width
3. All footer links across 27 pages point to valid destinations
4. Competitor icons load from Apple CDN
5. Schema.org validates via Google Rich Results Test
6. No broken internal links
7. Each page has unique title + meta description
8. Deploy to Cloudflare Pages and verify live
