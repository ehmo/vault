## User Prompts

### Prompt 1

audit

### Prompt 2

[Request interrupted by user]

### Prompt 3

Investigate issue with coloring of the app (see video /Users/nan/Downloads/ScreenRecording_02-17-2026\ 10-14-34_1.MP4)>

When I open vault you can see that the app gets recolored, with the top having some kind of weird noticable lag.

When I got to app settings and change appearance, you can visibly see the recoloring happening separately for the top and the rest of the screen.

It's important that either the color changes instantenously or that it's smooth across the whole screen

### Prompt 4

Yes

### Prompt 5

it still does the same thing, the top changes separately see video /Users/nan/Library/CloudStorage/Dropbox/Screenshots/Simulator\ Screen\ Recording\ -\ iphone\ 17\ pro\ -\ 2026-02-17\ at\ 10.47.14.mov

And the appearance selector in settings stopped working

### Prompt 6

The appearance setting is working once (changed to dark) but doesn't work to change anything back. The animation is exactly the same and not resolved

### Prompt 7

The appearance is now working, but the animation somehow gotten worse (see video) /Users/nan/Library/CloudStorage/Dropbox/Screenshots/Simulator\ Screen\ Recording\ -\ iphone\ 17\ pro\ -\ 2026-02-17\ at\ 10.57.40.mov

### Prompt 8

Still the same. It colors the top differently than the bottom

### Prompt 9

Yes, it's still visible

### Prompt 10

Still the same

### Prompt 11

Yes, this solved it in the appearance. Although the timing of change of the text color is a bit off.

Fix it on the unlock vault page too

### Prompt 12

The appearance settings works great. But recoloring of the vault is still occuring

### Prompt 13

Still the same

### Prompt 14

I can't get the app to reload. It opens but it doesn't show anything

### Prompt 15

Now it loads but the fill in effect is still there. I would like you to pause, research this and investigate thoroughly before continuing as this was 7th attempt
