Implement the following plan:

# Share Extension Test Suite

## Context

The share extension has had multiple memory crash fixes and hardening over the last session. User wants comprehensive tests to catch regressions fast. Currently **zero tests** exist for streaming encryption, staged import manager, or the share extension flow. Existing CryptoEngineTests only covers single-shot encrypt/decrypt, file headers, HMAC, and streaming format detection.

## Plan

Create **3 new test files** covering all testable share extension code paths:

### 1. `CryptoStreamingTests.swift` — Streaming encryption/decryption edge cases

Tests the code paths the share extension actually uses. **Not covered by existing CryptoEngineTests.**

| Test | What it validates |
|------|-------------------|
| `testStreamingEncryptDecryptRoundTrip` | Encrypt file > threshold via streaming, decrypt, compare bytes |
| `testSingleShotEncryptDecryptAtThreshold` | File exactly at 1MB → single-shot path |
| `testStreamingEncryptDecryptOneByteOverThreshold` | 1MB+1 → streaming path kicks in |
| `testEncryptDecryptEmptyFile` | 0-byte file → single-shot, 28 bytes overhead |
| `testEncryptDecryptOneByte` | 1-byte file → single-shot, 29 bytes encrypted |
| `testEncryptDecryptLastChunkPartial` | File that doesn't divide evenly into 256KB chunks |
| `testStreamingToHandleRoundTrip` | `encryptFileStreamingToHandle` → `decryptStreamingToFile` |
| `testStreamingToHandleSmallFile` | Handle path with file ≤ threshold → single-shot write |
| `testDecryptStagedAutoDetectsFormat` | `decryptStaged` picks correct path for both formats |
| `testEncryptedContentSizeAccuracy` | `encryptedContentSize()` matches actual encrypted output for small, threshold, and large files |
| `testStreamingFromHandleToFileRoundTrip` | `decryptStreamingFromHandleToFile` → verify original bytes |
| `testWrongKeyDecryptionFails` | Encrypt with key A, decrypt with key B → throws |
| `testTruncatedStreamingHeaderThrows` | < 33 bytes of streaming data → CryptoError.invalidData |
| `testWrongMagicNumberThrows` | Correct size but wrong magic → CryptoError.invalidData |
| `testTruncatedChunkDataThrows` | Valid header but chunk claims more bytes than available |
| `testCorruptedChunkContentThrows` | Valid header + valid chunk size but garbled ciphertext |
| `testInvalidKeyLengthThrows` | 16-byte, 64-byte, and empty keys → keyGenerationFailed |
| `testXorNonceProducesDifferentNonces` | Index 0 vs 1 produce distinct nonces |
| `testXorNonceInvalidBaseLengthThrows` | 11-byte base nonce → invalidData |
| `testReadExactShortReadThrows` | FileHandle with fewer bytes than requested |
| `testMultiChunkStreamingIntegrity` | Large file (3MB+) → verify every byte survives round-trip |

### 2. `StagedImportManagerTests.swift` — Batch management edge cases

Uses a temp directory as a fake app-group container. Tests batch lifecycle.

| Test | What it validates |
|------|-------------------|
| `testCreateBatchCreatesDirectory` | Batch dir created, UUID returned |
| `testWriteAndReadManifestRoundTrip` | JSON encode → decode preserves all fields |
| `testManifestRetryCountDefaultsToZero` | New manifest has retryCount=0 |
| `testWriteAndReadEncryptedFile` | Write .enc file → read returns same bytes |
| `testWriteAndReadEncryptedThumbnail` | Write .thumb.enc → read returns same bytes |
| `testReadNonexistentFileReturnsNil` | readEncryptedFile for missing UUID → nil |
| `testReadNonexistentThumbnailReturnsNil` | readEncryptedThumbnail for missing UUID → nil |
| `testPendingBatchesFiltersByFingerprint` | Two batches with different fingerprints → only matching returned |
| `testPendingBatchesSortedByTimestamp` | Older batch appears first |
| `testPendingFileCountAcrossMultipleBatches` | Sum of files across matching batches |
| `testDeleteBatchRemovesDirectory` | deleteBatch → dir gone |
| `testIncrementRetryKeepsBatchAtRetryZero` | First call → retryCount 1, batch kept |
| `testIncrementRetryDeletesBatchAtRetryOne` | Second call → retryCount 2, batch deleted |
| `testIncrementRetryDeletesOrphanedBatch` | No manifest → batch deleted |
| `testCleanupOrphansDeletesDirsWithoutManifest` | Orphan dir removed, valid batch kept |
| `testCleanupExpiredDeletesOldBatches` | Batch older than interval removed |
| `testCleanupExpiredKeepsRecentBatches` | Batch newer than interval kept |
| `testDeleteAllBatches` | All batch dirs removed, returns count |
| `testTotalPendingSizeCalculation` | Sum of all file sizes in all batches |
| `testManifestCodableRoundTripWithAllFields` | All StagedFileMetadata fields preserved through JSON |
| `testManifestWithNilSourceAppBundleId` | Optional field encodes/decodes correctly |

### 3. `ShareExtensionIntegrationTests.swift` — End-to-end share flow

Tests the full encrypt-stage-read cycle that the share extension performs.

| Test | What it validates |
|------|-------------------|
| `testFullShareFlowSmallFile` | Write file < 1MB → encrypt → stage → read back → decrypt → compare |
| `testFullShareFlowLargeFile` | Write file > 1MB → streaming encrypt → stage → read back → decrypt |
| `testFullShareFlowMultipleFiles` | 5 files in one batch → all round-trip correctly |
| `testThumbnailEncryptDecryptRoundTrip` | Encrypt thumbnail data → write to batch → read → decrypt → compare |
| `testBatchManifestRecordsCorrectMetadata` | Verify filename, mimeType, originalSize, encryptedSize, hasThumbnail |
| `testEncryptedSizeLargerThanOriginal` | encryptedSize > originalSize for all files (AES-GCM overhead) |
| `testBatchWithMixedFileSizes` | Mix of small and large files in one batch → all correct |
| `testFreeTierLimitEnforcement` | Verify limit check logic for images, videos, files |
| `testPremiumBypassesFreeTierLimits` | Premium flag → no limit errors |
| `testKeyFingerprintMatchesAcrossFlows` | Same key → same fingerprint in extension and main app read |
| `testMultipleBatchesSameKey` | Two separate shares → two batches → both readable |
| `testCleanupAfterSuccessfulImport` | deleteBatch removes all files + manifest |
| `testAtomicManifestVisibility` | Files written before manifest → batch only visible after manifest write |

## Files to create

1. `/Users/nan/Work/ai/vault/apps/ios/VaultTests/CryptoStreamingTests.swift`
2. `/Users/nan/Work/ai/vault/apps/ios/VaultTests/StagedImportManagerTests.swift`
3. `/Users/nan/Work/ai/vault/apps/ios/VaultTests/ShareExtensionIntegrationTests.swift`

## Files to modify

- `/Users/nan/Work/ai/vault/apps/ios/Vault.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj` — register new test files in VaultTests target

## Patterns to follow

- `import XCTest` + `@testable import Vault`
- `final class XTests: XCTestCase`
- MARK comments for grouping
- `setUp()`/`tearDown()` for temp directory cleanup
- Generate test keys with `CryptoEngine.generateRandomBytes(count: 32)!`
- Use temp directories for all file I/O: `FileManager.default.temporaryDirectory.appendingPathComponent(UUID().uuidString)`

## Verification

```bash
xcodebuild test -project Vault.xcodeproj -scheme Vault \
  -destination 'id=57965726-931A-462A-A262-3A3DAFA7CDDF' \
  -only-testing:VaultTests/CryptoStreamingTests \
  -only-testing:VaultTests/StagedImportManagerTests \
  -only-testing:VaultTests/ShareExtensionIntegrationTests
```

# Xcode Build and Export

Use this skill when you need to build an app from source and prepare it for upload to App Store Connect.

## Preconditions
- Xcode installed and command line tools configured
- Valid signing identity and provisioning profiles (or automatic signing enabled)

## iOS Build Flow

### 1. Clean and Archive
```bash
xcodebuild clean archive \
  -scheme "YourScheme" \
  -configuration Release \
  -archivePath /tmp/YourApp.xcarchive \
  -destination "generic/platform=iOS"
```

### 2. Export IPA
```bash
xcodebuild -exportArchive \
  -archivePath /tmp/YourApp.xcarchive \
  -exportPath /tmp/YourAppExport \
  -exportOptionsPlist ExportOptions.plist \
  -allowProvisioningUpdates
```

A minimal `ExportOptions.plist` for App Store distribution:
```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
<plist version="1.0">
<dict>
    <key>method</key>
    <string>app-store-connect</string>
    <key>teamID</key>
    <string>YOUR_TEAM_ID</string>
</dict>
</plist>
```

### 3. Upload with asc
```bash
asc builds upload --app "APP_ID" --ipa "/tmp/YourAppExport/YourApp.ipa"
```

## macOS Build Flow

### 1. Archive
```bash
xcodebuild archive \
  -scheme "YourMacScheme" \
  -configuration Release \
  -archivePath /tmp/YourMacApp.xcarchive \
  -destination "generic/platform=macOS"
```

### 2. Export PKG
```bash
xcodebuild -exportArchive \
  -archivePath /tmp/YourMacApp.xcarchive \
  -exportPath /tmp/YourMacAppExport \
  -exportOptionsPlist ExportOptions.plist \
  -allowProvisioningUpdates
```

### 3. Upload PKG
macOS apps export as `.pkg` files. Use `xcrun altool`:
```bash
xcrun altool --upload-app \
  -f "/tmp/YourMacAppExport/YourApp.pkg" \
  --type macos \
  --apiKey "$ASC_KEY_ID" \
  --apiIssuer "$ASC_ISSUER_ID"
```

Note: The API key file must be in `~/.appstoreconnect/private_keys/AuthKey_<KEY_ID>.p8`

## Build Number Management

Each upload requires a unique build number higher than previously uploaded builds.

In Xcode project settings:
- `CURRENT_PROJECT_VERSION` - build number (e.g., "316")
- `MARKETING_VERSION` - version string (e.g., "2.2.0")

Check existing builds:
```bash
asc builds list --app "APP_ID" --platform IOS --limit 5
```

## Troubleshooting

### "No profiles for bundle ID" during export
- Add `-allowProvisioningUpdates` flag
- Verify your Apple ID is logged into Xcode

### Build rejected for missing icon (macOS)
macOS requires ICNS format icons with all sizes:
- 16x16, 32x32, 128x128, 256x256, 512x512 (1x and 2x)

### CFBundleVersion too low
The build number must be higher than any previously uploaded build. Increment `CURRENT_PROJECT_VERSION` and rebuild.

## Notes
- Always clean before archive for release builds
- Use `xcodebuild -showBuildSettings` to verify configuration
- For submission issues (encryption, content rights), see `asc-submission-health` skill

When I switch between light and dark the change is imminent but system is not. It should read what the system's default is and change should be immediate

---

Once again, lots of screens have default black background. In dark mode the only background allowed should be the one from image 6. In light mode the all white is also weird. It should use the light gray or whatever the color is used in many of the other screens. It's important that you get this right and keep it correct across the screens as any issue breaks the pattern and confuses the user

This session is being continued from a previous conversation that ran out of context. The summary below covers the earlier portion of the conversation.

Analysis:
Let me chronologically analyze the conversation:

1. **First user request**: Implement a detailed plan for a Share Extension Test Suite. The plan specified 3 new test files with specific test cases for CryptoStreamingTests (21 tests), StagedImportManagerTests (21 tests), and ShareExtensionIntegrationTests (13 tests).

2. **My approach**: 
   - Read source files: CryptoEngine.swift, StagedImportManager.swift, CryptoEngineTests.swift, VaultCoreConstants.swift
   - Read ShareViewController.swift, AGENTS.md, project.pbxproj
   - Made CryptoEngine's `xorNonce` and `readExact` methods internal (from private) for testability
   - Added `testPendingImportsOverride` DEBUG-only URL override to VaultCoreConstants for StagedImportManager tests
   - Created all 3 test files
   - Registered them in project.pbxproj (PBXBuildFile, PBXFileReference, PBXGroup, PBXSourcesBuildPhase)
   - All 54 tests passed, full suite of 246 tests passed
   - Committed and pushed

3. **Second user request**: "Push it to testflight"
   - Found build number 36, bumped to 37
   - Archived and exported
   - Hit "Failed to Use Accounts" error during export
   - Found ASC API key in keychain (GGJ9L8Y97B, issuer 3c53a69e-b7d6-4d46-a26b-2f2d02c69ccb)
   - Successfully uploaded build 37 to TestFlight
   - Committed build bump and pushed

4. **Third user request**: Fix system appearance mode not applying immediately
   - Investigated VaultApp.swift, SettingsView.swift, VaultView.swift
   - Root cause: `preferredColorScheme(nil)` for system mode doesn't force SwiftUI to immediately re-render
   - Fix: Added `resolvedSystemScheme` and `effectiveColorScheme` to AppState that reads the actual system color scheme from UIWindowScene's traitCollection
   - Added `refreshSystemAppearance()` method
   - Added scenePhase handler to refresh on app activation
   - Updated both VaultApp and VaultView to use `effectiveColorScheme`
   - Build succeeded, all tests passed
   - Bumped build to 38, uploaded to TestFlight, pushed

5. **Fourth (current) user request**: Background color consistency issue across screens
   - User shows screenshots where:
     - Image 1 (empty vault): Pure black background - WRONG
     - Image 2 (pattern confirm onboarding): Dark navy/VaultBackground - CORRECT
     - Image 3 (permissions onboarding): Pure black background - WRONG  
     - Image 4 (welcome onboarding): Dark navy/VaultBackground with slight black strip at top - MOSTLY CORRECT
     - Image 5 (vault with files): Dark navy/VaultBackground - CORRECT
     - Image 6 (pattern confirm - same as 2): Dark navy/VaultBackground - CORRECT (this is the reference)
   - User says: "In dark mode the only background allowed should be the one from image 6" (the dark navy VaultBackground)
   - User says: "In light mode the all white is also weird. It should use the light gray or whatever the color is used in many of the other screens"
   - User emphasizes consistency is critical

The screens that need fixing are:
- Empty vault view (image 1) - has pure black instead of VaultBackground
- Permissions onboarding step (image 3) - has pure black instead of VaultBackground
- Welcome onboarding step (image 4) - has a black strip at top
- Light mode screens using pure white instead of the light gray VaultBackground

The user has asked me to create a summary of the conversation. This is the current task.

Key files modified in this session:
- CryptoEngine.swift (xorNonce/readExact visibility)
- VaultCoreConstants.swift (testPendingImportsOverride)
- CryptoStreamingTests.swift (new)
- StagedImportManagerTests.swift (new)
- ShareExtensionIntegrationTests.swift (new)
- project.pbxproj (new test files, build bumps 36→37→38)
- VaultApp.swift (effectiveColorScheme, refreshSystemAppearance, scenePhase handler)
- VaultView.swift (effectiveColorScheme)

The pending task is the background color consistency fix across all screens.

Summary:
1. Primary Request and Intent:
   - **Task 1 (Completed)**: Implement comprehensive share extension test suite with 3 new test files covering streaming encryption, staged import manager, and end-to-end share flow (54 total tests)
   - **Task 2 (Completed)**: Push build to TestFlight
   - **Task 3 (Completed)**: Fix system appearance mode not applying immediately when switching from light/dark to "System"
   - **Task 4 (Completed)**: Push updated build to TestFlight (build 38)
   - **Task 5 (PENDING - Current)**: Fix background color inconsistency across ALL screens. User reports pure black backgrounds appearing on several screens in dark mode instead of the dark navy VaultBackground color (shown in screenshot 6/pattern confirm screen). Light mode also has pure white where it should use the light gray VaultBackground. User emphasizes consistency is critical — "any issue breaks the pattern and confuses the user."

2. Key Technical Concepts:
   - iOS SwiftUI app with `@Observable` pattern (iOS 17+)
   - AES-256-GCM streaming encryption with VCSE format (256KB chunks, 1MB threshold)
   - `StagedImportManager` uses app group container for share extension ↔ main app communication
   - `VaultCoreConstants.testPendingImportsOverride` (DEBUG-only) enables testing without app group
   - `preferredColorScheme(nil)` doesn't force immediate SwiftUI re-render for system mode
   - UIWindowScene traitCollection provides unoverridden system appearance
   - `overrideUserInterfaceStyle` on UIKit windows propagates to all presented view controllers
   - VaultBackground is the correct background color in both modes (dark navy in dark, light gray in light)
   - TestFlight upload requires ASC API key flags when `Failed to Use Accounts` error occurs
   - pbxproj uses TS prefix IDs for test target entries

3. Files and Code Sections:

   - **`apps/ios/Vault/Core/Crypto/CryptoEngine.swift`**
     - Made `xorNonce` and `readExact` internal (from private) for test access via `@testable import`
     - Contains streaming encryption/decryption (VCSE format), single-shot AES-GCM, FileHandle streaming paths
     ```swift
     static func xorNonce(_ baseNonce: Data, with index: UInt64) throws -> Data {
     static func readExact(_ count: Int, from handle: FileHandle) throws -> Data {
     ```

   - **`apps/ios/Vault/Core/VaultCoreConstants.swift`**
     - Added DEBUG-only test URL override for StagedImportManager tests
     ```swift
     #if DEBUG
     static var testPendingImportsOverride: URL?
     #endif
     static var pendingImportsURL: URL? {
         #if DEBUG
         if let override = testPendingImportsOverride { return override }
         #endif
         return appGroupContainerURL?.appendingPathComponent(pendingImportsDirectory)
     }
     ```
     - Constants: `streamingThreshold = 1_048_576` (1MB), `streamingChunkSize = 262_144` (256KB), `streamingMagic = 0x56435345`

   - **`apps/ios/VaultTests/CryptoStreamingTests.swift`** (NEW - 21 tests)
     - Streaming encrypt/decrypt round trips, threshold boundary tests (0, 1, exact, +1 byte), partial chunks, FileHandle paths, error cases (wrong key, truncated header, wrong magic, corrupted chunks, invalid key lengths), xorNonce, readExact

   - **`apps/ios/VaultTests/StagedImportManagerTests.swift`** (NEW - 21 tests)
     - Uses `VaultCoreConstants.testPendingImportsOverride = tempDir` in setUp
     - Batch creation, manifest codable round-trip, file/thumbnail read-write, fingerprint filtering, timestamp sorting, retry logic, orphan cleanup, expired batch cleanup

   - **`apps/ios/VaultTests/ShareExtensionIntegrationTests.swift`** (NEW - 12 tests)
     - End-to-end encrypt→stage→read→decrypt for small/large/mixed files, thumbnails, metadata validation, atomic manifest visibility

   - **`apps/ios/Vault/App/VaultApp.swift`**
     - Added `resolvedSystemScheme`, `effectiveColorScheme`, `refreshSystemAppearance()` to AppState
     - Added `@Environment(\.scenePhase)` and `onChange(of: scenePhase)` handler
     - Changed `.preferredColorScheme(appState.appearanceMode.preferredColorScheme)` to `.preferredColorScheme(appState.effectiveColorScheme)`
     ```swift
     private var resolvedSystemScheme: ColorScheme?
     var effectiveColorScheme: ColorScheme? {
         switch appearanceMode {
         case .system: resolvedSystemScheme
         case .light: .light
         case .dark: .dark
         }
     }
     func refreshSystemAppearance() {
         guard appearanceMode == .system else { return }
         guard let scene = UIApplication.shared.connectedScenes.first as? UIWindowScene else {
             resolvedSystemScheme = nil
             return
         }
         resolvedSystemScheme = scene.traitCollection.userInterfaceStyle == .dark ? .dark : .light
     }
     ```

   - **`apps/ios/Vault/Features/VaultViewer/VaultView.swift`**
     - Changed `.preferredColorScheme(appState.appearanceMode.preferredColorScheme)` to `.preferredColorScheme(appState.effectiveColorScheme)`

   - **`apps/ios/Vault.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj`**
     - Added 3 new test files with TS prefix IDs (TS0000030-TS0000035)
     - Build number bumped: 36 → 37 → 38

   - **`apps/ios/Vault/Core/Storage/StagedImportManager.swift`** (read only)
     - `StagedImportManifest` and `StagedFileMetadata` Codable structs
     - Batch lifecycle: createBatch, writeManifest, writeEncryptedFile, pendingBatches, deleteBatch, incrementRetryOrDelete, cleanupOrphans, cleanupExpiredBatches

   - **`apps/ios/Vault/Extensions/ShareExtension/ShareViewController.swift`** (read only)
     - Uses `CryptoEngine.encryptFileStreamingToHandle` for memory-safe encryption
     - `autoreleasepool` around synchronous file I/O
     - `isProcessing` guard against double-invocation

   - **`apps/ios/AGENTS.md`** (read only)
     - Build command, pbxproj ID conventions (TS prefix for tests), TestFlight notes
     - ASC API key auth flags needed when `Failed to Use Accounts`

4. Errors and Fixes:
   - **TestFlight `Failed to Use Accounts` error**: Fixed by adding `-authenticationKeyPath`, `-authenticationKeyID`, `-authenticationKeyIssuerID` flags to xcodebuild export command. Key found via `security find-generic-password -s "asc" -a "asc:credential:Vaultaire" -w`
   - **xcodebuild test quoting issue**: `-only-testing:VaultTests/X` with colon confused the parser. Fixed by using `-only-testing VaultTests/X` (space instead of colon)
   - **System appearance mode not updating immediately**: `preferredColorScheme(nil)` removes SwiftUI override but doesn't force re-render. Fixed by reading actual system scheme from `UIWindowScene.traitCollection.userInterfaceStyle` and setting explicit value via `effectiveColorScheme`
   - **SourceKit diagnostics noise**: "Cannot find type" errors after editing VaultApp.swift were false positives from SourceKit, not real build errors — build succeeded

5. Problem Solving:
   - **StagedImportManager testability**: App group container URL is nil in test environment. Solved with DEBUG-only `testPendingImportsOverride` static var on VaultCoreConstants
   - **Private method testing**: `xorNonce` and `readExact` were private, inaccessible even with `@testable import`. Changed to internal (removed `private` keyword)
   - **ASC credential discovery**: No `.p8` file in standard location. Found via `find ~ -name "AuthKey_*.p8"` and extracted issuer ID from keychain with `security find-generic-password`

6. All User Messages:
   - "Implement the following plan: [detailed Share Extension Test Suite plan with 3 files and ~55 test cases]"
   - "Push it to testflight"
   - "When I switch between light and dark the change is imminent but system is not. It should read what the system's default is and change should be immediate"
   - "Once again, lots of screens have default black background. In dark mode the only background allowed should be the one from image 6. In light mode the all white is also weird. It should use the light gray or whatever the color is used in many of the other screens. It's important that you get this right and keep it correct across the screens as any issue breaks the pattern and confuses the user" [with 6 screenshots showing the issue]

7. Pending Tasks:
   - **Fix background color inconsistency across ALL screens**: Multiple screens show pure black (#000000) background in dark mode instead of VaultBackground (dark navy ~#1C1C2E). Screens needing fixes based on screenshots:
     - Empty vault view (screenshot 1): pure black background
     - Permissions onboarding step (screenshot 3): pure black background
     - Welcome onboarding step (screenshot 4): dark navy but black strip at top
     - Light mode screens: pure white instead of light gray VaultBackground
   - Correct reference: Screenshot 2/6 (pattern confirm) and screenshot 5 (vault with files) show the correct VaultBackground
   - Need to audit ALL screens systematically and apply VaultBackground consistently

8. Current Work:
   The user just submitted their most recent request about background color inconsistency. The screenshots show:
   - Screenshot 1 (empty vault): Pure black — needs VaultBackground
   - Screenshot 2 (pattern confirm): Dark navy VaultBackground — CORRECT (reference)
   - Screenshot 3 (permissions): Pure black — needs VaultBackground
   - Screenshot 4 (welcome): Mostly correct but black strip at top
   - Screenshot 5 (vault with files): Correct VaultBackground
   - Screenshot 6 (pattern confirm): CORRECT — this is the target appearance
   
   No work has been started on this task yet. The summary was requested before beginning implementation.

9. Optional Next Step:
   Investigate and fix background colors across all screens. User's exact words: "In dark mode the only background allowed should be the one from image 6. In light mode the all white is also weird. It should use the light gray or whatever the color is used in many of the other screens."
   
   Steps needed:
   1. Find the VaultBackground color asset definition to understand what it resolves to in light/dark
   2. Find screens using `.background(Color.black)`, `.background(.black)`, or missing background modifiers
   3. Systematically audit all screens — particularly empty vault view, onboarding welcome, onboarding permissions, and any light-mode screens
   4. Apply `Color(.vaultBackground)` or equivalent consistently
   5. Build, verify, bump build, push to TestFlight

Please continue the conversation from where we left off without asking the user any further questions. Continue with the last task that you were asked to work on.

When adding files while in free version, there is some kind of weird issue. I added 25 files which maybe pushes some type over the limit (or some other reason). I click import and nothing happens /Users/nan/Downloads/ScreenRecording_02-14-2026\ 23-05-47_1.MP4

When I switch to paid and do it again all files that are loaded are broken /Users/nan/Downloads/ScreenRecording_02-14-2026\ 23-07-58_1.MP4

Investiage and fix it

This session is being continued from a previous conversation that ran out of context. The summary below covers the earlier portion of the conversation.

Analysis:
Let me chronologically analyze the conversation:

**Prior Session Summary (from context recovery):**
The conversation was continued from a previous session that completed several tasks:
1. Implemented comprehensive share extension test suite (3 files, 54 tests) - COMPLETED
2. Pushed build 37 to TestFlight - COMPLETED
3. Fixed system appearance mode not applying immediately - COMPLETED
4. Pushed build 38 to TestFlight - COMPLETED
5. Background color consistency fix across screens - PENDING (was the active task)

**Current Session - Part 1: Background Color Consistency Fix**

The user's previous request (from before compaction) was about fixing background colors across all screens. Pure black was showing in dark mode instead of VaultBackground (dark navy #20233C), and pure white in light mode instead of VaultBackground (light lavender #D1D1E9).

I:
1. Launched two Explore agents to find VaultBackground color definition and audit all views

**Current Session - Part 2: Two Import Bugs**

User reported two bugs with screen recordings:

**Bug 1 (Recording 1 - Free tier):** User has 21 files (52.4 MB), 25 files staged from share extension. Taps "Import" button → nothing happens, banner disappears, no files imported.

**Bug 2 (Recording 2 - Premium tier):** User has 65 files staged. After switching to paid and importing, all newly imported files show as blank gray squares (broken thumbnails), while original 21 files display correctly.

I began investigating by:
1. Extracting frames from both screen recordings with ffmpeg
2. Reading the PendingImportBanner component
3. Reading importPendingFiles() in VaultView+Actions.swift
4. Reading ImportIngestor.swift (processes staged imports)
5. Reading VaultStorage.swift (storeFile, storeFileFromURL, listFilesLightweight)
6. Reading ShareViewController.swift (how share extension encrypts files)
7. Reading VaultCoreConstants.swift (free tier limits)
8. Reading VaultStorage blob management code

**Key findings so far:**

For Bug 1 (Free tier import fails silently):
- `importPendingFiles()` calls `ImportIngestor.processPendingImports(for: vaultKey)`
- ImportIngestor calls `VaultStorage.shared.storeFileFromURL()` for each file
- In `storeFileFromURL`, if no existing blob has enough space, it tries to expand
- Expansion is gated by `SubscriptionManager.isPremiumSnapshot` - if false (free tier), throws `VaultStorageError.expansionNotAllowed`
- The blob default size is only 50MB (`defaultBlobSize = 50 * 1024 * 1024`)
- User already has 52.4 MB of data, so the blob is likely full
- When ALL files fail, `result.imported == 0`, so `loadFiles()` is never called
- `appState.hasPendingImports = false` is set unconditionally, hiding the banner
- **There is NO error feedback shown to the user** - no toast, no alert

For Bug 2 (Broken thumbnails on import):
- Still under investigation
- Share extension encrypts thumbnails with vault key: `CryptoEngine.encrypt(thumbData, with: key)`
- ImportIngestor decrypts thumbnails with vault key: `try? CryptoEngine.decrypt(encThumb, with: vaultKey)` - uses `try?` which silently swallows errors
- VaultStorage re-encrypts with master key: `try? CryptoEngine.encrypt(thumbnail, with: masterKey)`
- The key hierarchy: vaultKey (pattern) → decrypts index, masterKey (in index) → encrypts files/thumbnails
- Possible causes: thumbnail decryption failure at ImportIngestor level, or thumbnail data not being stored correctly

I was in the middle of investigating `listFilesLightweight` and the thumbnail display chain when the summary was requested.

**Files Modified in This Session:**
1. OnboardingView.swift - Added VaultBackground to VStack
2. PermissionsView.swift - Added VaultBackground
3. AnalyticsConsentView.swift - Added VaultBackground
4. ThankYouView.swift - Added VaultBackground
5. PaywallStepView.swift - Added VaultBackground
6. VaultView.swift - Added VaultBackground to NavigationStack Group
7. LoadingView.swift - Added VaultBackground with frame fill
8. SharedVaultInviteView.swift - Added VaultBackground
9. ShareVaultView.swift - Added VaultBackground

**Files Read During Bug Investigation:**
- VaultView+Actions.swift (importPendingFiles, loadFiles, handleSelectedPhotos, performPhotoImport)
- ImportIngestor.swift (processPendingImports, processBatch)
- VaultStorage.swift (storeFileFromURL, storeFile, listFilesLightweight, VaultIndex, BlobDescriptor, migrateToV3)
- ShareViewController.swift (processFiles, processAttachment, encryption)
- PendingImportBanner.swift
- VaultView+Toolbar.swift (topSafeAreaContent)
- VaultCoreConstants.swift (freeMaxImages=100, freeMaxVideos=10, freeMaxFiles=100)
- SubscriptionManager.swift (isPremiumSnapshot references)

**Background changes NOT yet committed.**
**Bug investigation NOT yet complete - no fixes applied.**

Summary:
1. Primary Request and Intent:
   - **Task 1 (COMPLETED but NOT COMMITTED):** Fix background color inconsistency across all screens. User reported pure black backgrounds in dark mode and pure white in light mode on several screens instead of the VaultBackground color (dark navy #20233C in dark, lavender #D1D1E9 in light). User emphasized: "In dark mode the only background allowed should be the one from image 6. In light mode the all white is also weird. It should use the light gray or whatever the color is used in many of the other screens. It's important that you get this right and keep it correct across the screens as any issue breaks the pattern and confuses the user."
   - **Task 2 (IN PROGRESS - INVESTIGATION PHASE):** Fix two import bugs reported with screen recordings:
     - Bug 1: Free tier - 25 files staged from share extension, clicking "Import" does nothing (banner disappears, no files imported)
     - Bug 2: Premium tier - 65 files import but all newly imported files show as blank/broken gray squares (thumbnails missing), while existing files display correctly

2. Key Technical Concepts:
   - iOS SwiftUI app with `@Observable` pattern (iOS 17+)
   - VaultBackground color asset: dark mode #20233C, light mode #D1D1E9, referenced as `Color.vaultBackground`
   - Two-tier key hierarchy: `vaultKey` (from pattern) decrypts vault index, `masterKey` (stored encrypted in index) encrypts/decrypts individual files and thumbnails
   - Blob storage system: `defaultBlobSize = 50 * 1024 * 1024` (50MB), legacy blobs can be 500MB
   - Blob expansion gated by `SubscriptionManager.isPremiumSnapshot` - free tier cannot expand blobs
   - Share extension encrypts files with vault key, stages to app group container via StagedImportManager
   - ImportIngestor decrypts staged files with vault key, then VaultStorage re-encrypts with master key
   - `CryptoEngine.encryptFileStreamingToHandle` for streaming encryption (256KB chunks, 1MB threshold)
   - `CryptoEngine.decryptStaged` auto-detects single-shot vs streaming format
   - Free tier limits in share extension: 100 images, 10 videos, 100 files per batch
   - `PendingImportBanner` component with local `isImporting` state for spinner

3. Files and Code Sections:

   **Modified (Background Fix - NOT YET COMMITTED):**
   
   - `apps/ios/Vault/Features/Onboarding/OnboardingView.swift`
     - Added `.background(Color.vaultBackground.ignoresSafeArea())` to the VStack containing progress bar + step views (fixes black strip at top of onboarding)
     ```swift
     }
     .background(Color.vaultBackground.ignoresSafeArea())
     ```
   
   - `apps/ios/Vault/Features/Onboarding/PermissionsView.swift`
     - Added VaultBackground before `.task` modifier (was pure black in dark mode)
     ```swift
     .background(Color.vaultBackground.ignoresSafeArea())
     .task {
         await checkCurrentStatuses()
     }
     ```
   
   - `apps/ios/Vault/Features/Onboarding/AnalyticsConsentView.swift`
     - Added VaultBackground to outer VStack
     ```swift
     .background(Color.vaultBackground.ignoresSafeArea())
     ```
   
   - `apps/ios/Vault/Features/Onboarding/ThankYouView.swift`
     - Added VaultBackground to outer VStack
   
   - `apps/ios/Vault/Features/Onboarding/PaywallStepView.swift`
     - Added VaultBackground to outer VStack
   
   - `apps/ios/Vault/Features/VaultViewer/VaultView.swift`
     - Added VaultBackground to NavigationStack's Group (fixes empty vault black background)
     ```swift
     }
     .background(Color.vaultBackground.ignoresSafeArea())
     .navigationTitle(appState.vaultName)
     .navigationBarTitleDisplayMode(.inline)
     ```
   
   - `apps/ios/Vault/UI/Components/LoadingView.swift`
     - Added frame fill + VaultBackground (was showing system black during unlock)
     ```swift
     struct LoadingView: View {
         var body: some View {
             VaultSyncIndicator(style: .loading, message: "Unlocking...")
                 .frame(maxWidth: .infinity, maxHeight: .infinity)
                 .background(Color.vaultBackground.ignoresSafeArea())
         }
     }
     ```
   
   - `apps/ios/Vault/Features/Sharing/SharedVaultInviteView.swift`
     - Added VaultBackground before `.task` modifier
   
   - `apps/ios/Vault/Features/Sharing/ShareVaultView.swift`
     - Added VaultBackground to ScrollView area inside NavigationStack

   **Read for Bug Investigation:**
   
   - `apps/ios/Vault/Features/VaultViewer/VaultView+Actions.swift`
     - Contains `importPendingFiles()` (line 121-135) - the critical function that processes staged imports
     - NO free tier limit check before calling ImportIngestor
     - NO error feedback when import fails (banner disappears silently)
     ```swift
     func importPendingFiles() {
         guard let vaultKey = appState.currentVaultKey else { return }
         Task {
             let result = await ImportIngestor.processPendingImports(for: vaultKey)
             await MainActor.run {
                 appState.hasPendingImports = false
                 appState.pendingImportCount = 0
                 if result.imported > 0 {
                     loadFiles()
                     let generator = UINotificationFeedbackGenerator()
                     generator.notificationOccurred(.success)
                 }
             }
         }
     }
     ```
   
   - `apps/ios/Vault/Core/Storage/ImportIngestor.swift`
     - `processPendingImports(for:)` - loops through batches, calls `processBatch`
     - `processBatch` per-file: readEncryptedFile → decryptStaged(vaultKey) → write temp → storeFileFromURL(vaultKey)
     - Thumbnail handling (line 87-94):
     ```swift
     var thumbnailData: Data?
     if file.hasThumbnail,
        let encThumb = StagedImportManager.readEncryptedThumbnail(
            batchId: batch.batchId, fileId: file.fileId) {
         thumbnailData = try? CryptoEngine.decrypt(encThumb, with: vaultKey)
     }
     ```
     - File decryption (line 84): `let decryptedData = try CryptoEngine.decryptStaged(encryptedData, with: vaultKey)`
     - Storage (line 104): `_ = try VaultStorage.shared.storeFileFromURL(tempURL, ..., with: vaultKey, thumbnailData: thumbnailData)`
   
   - `apps/ios/Vault/Core/Storage/VaultStorage.swift`
     - `storeFileFromURL` (line 875-980) - the critical storage function
     - Blob expansion check (line 910-913) - **ROOT CAUSE of Bug 1**:
     ```swift
     if targetBlobIndex == nil {
         guard SubscriptionManager.isPremiumSnapshot else {
             throw VaultStorageError.expansionNotAllowed
         }
     ```
     - Default blob size only 50MB (line 42): `private let defaultBlobSize: Int = 50 * 1024 * 1024`
     - `cursorBlockOffset` = 50MB - 16 bytes (line 45)
     - Thumbnail encryption in storeFileFromURL (line 949-952) - re-encrypts with masterKey:
     ```swift
     var encryptedThumbnail: Data? = nil
     if let thumbnail = thumbnailData {
         encryptedThumbnail = try? CryptoEngine.encrypt(thumbnail, with: masterKey)
     }
     ```
     - `listFilesLightweight` (line 1233-1253) returns `entry.thumbnailData` (encrypted with masterKey) and `masterKey` for display
   
   - `apps/ios/Vault/Extensions/ShareExtension/ShareViewController.swift`
     - File encryption (line 227): `try CryptoEngine.encryptFileStreamingToHandle(from: tempURL, to: outputHandle, with: key)` — uses vault key
     - Thumbnail encryption (line 234): `let encThumb = try CryptoEngine.encrypt(thumbData, with: key)` — uses vault key
     - Free tier check (lines 146-159): checks `isPremium` from UserDefaults app group, limits per batch (not total vault count)
   
   - `apps/ios/Vault/UI/Components/PendingImportBanner.swift`
     - Simple banner with local `isImporting` state, shows spinner when Import tapped
     - Calls `onImport()` closure which maps to `importPendingFiles()`
   
   - `apps/ios/Vault/Features/VaultViewer/VaultView+Toolbar.swift`
     - `topSafeAreaContent` (line 38-61) shows PendingImportBanner when `appState.hasPendingImports`
   
   - `apps/ios/Vault/Core/Billing/SubscriptionManager.swift`
     - `isPremiumSnapshot` is `nonisolated(unsafe) static var` (line 206) - used by VaultStorage for blob expansion check

4. Errors and fixes:
   - **SourceKit false positive diagnostics**: After editing OnboardingView.swift, PermissionsView.swift, etc., SourceKit reported "Cannot find type" errors. These are cross-file resolution failures in the editor, not real build errors. The actual xcodebuild succeeded.
   - **Simulator not found**: `iPhone 16 Pro` simulator doesn't exist. Fixed by using `iPhone 17 Pro` ID (`57965726-931A-462A-A262-3A3DAFA7CDDF`).
   - **Simulator deleted/boot error**: The iPhone 17 Pro with ID `57965726...` was a "deleted device". Used the booted `iphone 17 pro` with ID `6627B57F-5EC5-4AB4-9695-69154B26952D` instead.
   - **Screen recording can't be read directly**: `.MP4` files are binary, can't use Read tool. Used `ffmpeg -vf "fps=1"` to extract frames as JPGs.

5. Problem Solving:

   **Solved: Background color consistency**
   - Audited all views systematically, found 9 views missing VaultBackground
   - Applied `.background(Color.vaultBackground.ignoresSafeArea())` to each
   - Build succeeded, all 246 tests passed
   - NOT YET COMMITTED

   **In Progress: Import bugs investigation**
   
   Bug 1 (Free tier import fails silently) - Root cause identified:
   - The 50MB blob is full (user has 52.4MB of data)
   - `storeFileFromURL` throws `expansionNotAllowed` for free tier when blob needs expansion
   - ALL 25 files fail, `result.imported == 0`, `loadFiles()` never called
   - `appState.hasPendingImports = false` set unconditionally → banner disappears
   - No error feedback shown to user
   
   Bug 2 (Broken thumbnails) - Still investigating:
   - Newly imported files show as gray blank squares
   - Share extension encrypts thumbnails with vault key
   - ImportIngestor decrypts with vault key (`try?` swallows errors)
   - VaultStorage re-encrypts with master key for index storage
   - Need to verify the full thumbnail chain works correctly
   - Possible causes: thumbnail decryption silently failing, thumbnail data being nil

6. All user messages:
   - (From prior session, summarized) "Once again, lots of screens have default black background. In dark mode the only background allowed should be the one from image 6. In light mode the all white is also weird. It should use the light gray or whatever the color is used in many of the other screens. It's important that you get this right and keep it correct across the screens as any issue breaks the pattern and confuses the user"
   - "When adding files while in free version, there is some kind of weird issue. I added 25 files which maybe pushes some type over the limit (or some other reason). I click import and nothing happens /Users/nan/Downloads/ScreenRecording_02-14-2026\ 23-05-47_1.MP4 When I switch to paid and do it again all files that are loaded are broken /Users/nan/Downloads/ScreenRecording_02-14-2026\ 23-07-58_1.MP4 Investiage and fix it"

7. Pending Tasks:
   - **Commit and push background color fix** (build passed, tests passed, changes uncommitted)
   - **Fix Bug 1: Free tier staged import fails silently** - Need to: (a) handle blob-full scenario gracefully for free tier, (b) show error feedback to user when import fails
   - **Fix Bug 2: Imported files have broken/missing thumbnails** - Need to complete investigation and fix the thumbnail chain
   - **Push to TestFlight** after fixes
   - **Session close protocol**: git add, bd sync, git commit, git push

8. Current Work:
   I was actively investigating two import bugs. I had just finished reading `VaultStorage.listFilesLightweight` (line 1233-1253) and was tracing the thumbnail display chain to understand why imported files show as broken gray squares. I had identified the likely root cause of Bug 1 (blob expansion blocked for free tier + no error feedback) but had not yet started writing fixes for either bug.

   The last code I read was:
   ```swift
   func listFilesLightweight(with key: Data) throws -> (masterKey: Data, files: [LightweightFileEntry]) {
       let index = try loadIndex(with: key)
       let masterKey = try getMasterKey(from: index, vaultKey: key)
       let entries = index.files.filter { !$0.isDeleted }.map { entry in
           LightweightFileEntry(
               fileId: entry.fileId, size: entry.size,
               encryptedThumbnail: entry.thumbnailData,
               mimeType: entry.mimeType, filename: entry.filename,
               createdAt: entry.createdAt, duration: entry.duration
           )
       }
       return (masterKey, entries)
   }
   ```

9. Optional Next Step:
   Continue investigating and fixing the two import bugs as requested: "Investiage and fix it"
   
   Specifically:
   1. First commit the background color changes (they're tested and ready)
   2. For Bug 1: Fix `importPendingFiles()` to either (a) check blob capacity before importing and show the free tier limit/paywall, or (b) handle `expansionNotAllowed` errors in ImportIngestor and return meaningful error info, AND add error feedback (toast message) when `result.failed > 0 && result.imported == 0`
   3. For Bug 2: Complete thumbnail investigation - check how thumbnails are displayed in the grid (find the decryption code in PhotosGridView or similar), verify the thumbnail chain from share extension → ImportIngestor → VaultStorage → display. The `try?` calls that silently swallow errors are suspicious and need investigation.
   4. Build, test, commit, bump build number, push to TestFlight

If you need specific details from before compaction (like exact code snippets, error messages, or content you generated), read the full transcript at: /Users/nan/.REDACTED.jsonl
Please continue the conversation from where we left off without asking the user any further questions. Continue with the last task that you were asked to work on.

I want you to verify that all screens match the same style guide and that you caught all bugs possible and that you wrote extensive tests preventing these bugs in the future. When done, push to testflight

This session is being continued from a previous conversation that ran out of context. The summary below covers the earlier portion of the conversation.

Analysis:
Let me chronologically analyze this conversation:

**Prior Session Context (from summary):**
- Background color consistency fix was completed but not committed (9 files modified)
- Two import bugs were being investigated:
  - Bug 1: Free tier import fails silently (25 staged files, click Import, nothing happens)
  - Bug 2: Premium tier import shows all newly imported files as blank gray squares (broken thumbnails)
- Root causes had been partially identified

**Current Session - Part 1: Committing Background Color Fix**
1. Checked git status - 9 view files + CLAUDE.md files modified
2. Staged the 9 background color fix files
3. Committed: "Add VaultBackground to 9 screens missing consistent background color"

**Current Session - Part 2: Investigating Import Bugs**
1. Launched two parallel Explore agents:
   - Agent 1: Traced complete thumbnail display chain from storage to screen
   - Agent 2: Investigated blob expansion logic and error handling chain

Key findings from Agent 1 (Thumbnail Chain):
- Share extension encrypts thumbnails with vault key
- ImportIngestor decrypts with vault key, passes plaintext to VaultStorage
- VaultStorage re-encrypts with masterKey, stores in index
- AsyncThumbnailView decrypts with masterKey for display
- Share extension ONLY generates thumbnails for images (`utType.conforms(to: .image)`), NOT videos
- Videos from share extension have no thumbnails → gray squares

Key findings from Agent 2 (Error Handling):
- Bug 1 root cause: 50MB blob is full, storeFileFromURL throws expansionNotAllowed, ImportIngestor catches generically, importPendingFiles() never checks result.failed, unconditionally hides banner
- No error feedback shown to user
- After 2 retries, files permanently deleted with no user notification

**Current Session - Part 3: Fixing Import Bugs**

Bug 1 Fix (ImportIngestor.swift):
- Added `failureReason: String?` to ImportResult struct
- Changed processBatch return type to include failureReason
- Track error.localizedDescription on catch

Bug 1 Fix (VaultView+Actions.swift - importPendingFiles):
- Show toast on failure with error reason
- Keep banner visible when all imports fail
- Only hide banner on success or no files
- Show filesImported toast on full success

Bug 2 Fix (ImportIngestor.swift):
- Added `generateThumbnail(for:mimeType:)` static method
- Uses FileUtilities.generateThumbnail(fromFileURL:) for images
- Uses AVAssetImageGenerator for videos (same pattern as VaultView+Actions.generateVideoMetadata)
- Called when thumbnailData is nil after share extension thumbnail check

Build succeeded, all 246 tests passed. Committed and pushed.

**Current Session - Part 4: Comprehensive Audit**
User requested: "I want you to verify that all screens match the same style guide and that you caught all bugs possible and that you wrote extensive tests preventing these bugs in the future. When done, push to testflight"

Launched two parallel Explore agents:
- Agent 1: Audited ALL 51 SwiftUI views for VaultBackground
- Agent 2: Audited entire import flow for remaining bugs

Agent 1 found 3 remaining background issues:
1. DuressSetupSheet - missing VaultBackground entirely
2. RestoreFromBackupView - missing VaultBackground entirely
3. FallbackPaywallView - has VaultBackground but missing .ignoresSafeArea()

Agent 2 found multiple bugs by severity:

HIGH:
- BUG 7/19: PendingImportBanner isImporting @State never resets on failure → spinner stuck forever
- BUG 13: performFileImport silently swallows all errors → no failedCount, shows "0 files imported"
- BUG 17: handleCapturedImage catch says "Handle error silently" → photo vanishes with no feedback

MEDIUM:
- BUG 4: Partial batch retry re-imports already-successful files as duplicates
- BUG 24: ImportIngestor loads entire decrypted file into memory
- BUG 25: importPendingFiles doesn't disable idle timer
- BUG 26: Share extension import bypasses 100-file free tier limit

**Current Session - Part 5: Fixing All Found Issues**

Fix 1 - VaultBackground (3 files):
- Added `.background(Color.vaultBackground.ignoresSafeArea())` to DuressSetupSheet in SettingsView.swift
- Added `.background(Color.vaultBackground.ignoresSafeArea())` to RestoreFromBackupView in SettingsView.swift
- Changed FallbackPaywallView from `.background(Color.vaultBackground)` to `.background(Color.vaultBackground.ignoresSafeArea())` in PaywallTrigger.swift

Fix 2 - PendingImportBanner stuck spinner:
- Changed from `@State private var isImporting` to `@Binding var isImporting` parameter
- Added `isImportingPendingFiles` @State to VaultView.swift
- Updated VaultView+Toolbar.swift to pass `$isImportingPendingFiles` binding
- Updated importPendingFiles() to reset `isImportingPendingFiles = false` on completion
- Added reentrancy guard: `guard !isImportingPendingFiles else { return }`

Fix 3 - importPendingFiles idle timer:
- Added `UIApplication.shared.isIdleTimerDisabled = true` at start
- Added `UIApplication.shared.isIdleTimerDisabled = false` on completion

Fix 4 - performFileImport error handling:
- Added `failedCount` and `lastErrorReason` tracking
- Changed security-scoped resource failure from silent `continue` to `failedCount += 1`
- Changed catch block to track `failedCount` and `lastErrorReason`
- Changed toast logic to show `.importFailed` when failures occur

Fix 5 - Camera capture error handling:
- Changed `// Handle error silently` to show `.importFailed` toast

**Current Session - Part 6: Writing Tests**
Created ImportIngestorTests.swift with 24 tests covering:
- ImportResult fields and failure reason propagation
- Missing encrypted file handling
- Thumbnail decryption/round-trip
- Empty batch handling
- Wrong key batch handling
- Corrupted data graceful failure
- Toast message formatting
- Retry behavior (2 attempts then delete)
- Thumbnail generation fallback from file

Added to Xcode project (project.pbxproj) with refs TS0000036/TS0000037.

Build succeeded, all tests passed (including new ImportIngestorTests).

**Current Session - Part 7: Committing and TestFlight**
- Committed all fixes + tests: "Harden import error handling, fix remaining backgrounds, add regression tests"
- Pushed to remote
- Bumped build number from 38 to 39
- Committed build bump
- Archived with xcodebuild clean archive
- Export failed initially with "Failed to Use Accounts" — fixed by removing `destination: upload` from ExportOptions.plist
- Export succeeded to /tmp/VaultExport/Vault.ipa
- Uploaded via `asc builds upload --app 6758529311`
- Build 39 processed as VALID
- Was about to add to TestFlight group when ran into `asc groups list` being unknown command
- Need to use `asc testflight` or `asc publish testflight` instead

**Errors encountered:**
1. `cannot find 'failed' in scope` - After changing processBatch return type, still referenced bare `failed` variable instead of `batchResult.failed`
2. Export archive "Failed to Use Accounts" - Fixed by removing `destination: upload` from ExportOptions.plist, exporting locally first, then uploading via `asc builds upload`
3. Wrong app ID for `asc builds upload` - Used 6741125727 instead of correct 6758529311
4. `asc groups list` is not a valid command - Need to use `asc testflight` or `asc publish testflight`

Summary:
1. Primary Request and Intent:
   - **From prior session**: Fix background color inconsistency across all screens (VaultBackground color: dark navy #20233C in dark mode, lavender #D1D1E9 in light mode). Fix two import bugs: (1) Free tier staged import fails silently with no feedback, (2) Premium tier imported files show as blank gray squares.
   - **Current session continuation**: Commit the background fixes, investigate and fix both import bugs, push to remote.
   - **New request**: "I want you to verify that all screens match the same style guide and that you caught all bugs possible and that you wrote extensive tests preventing these bugs in the future. When done, push to testflight"

2. Key Technical Concepts:
   - iOS SwiftUI app with `@Observable` pattern (iOS 17+)
   - Two-tier key hierarchy: `vaultKey` (from pattern) decrypts vault index, `masterKey` (stored encrypted in index) encrypts/decrypts individual files and thumbnails
   - Blob storage system: `defaultBlobSize = 50 * 1024 * 1024` (50MB), expansion gated by `SubscriptionManager.isPremiumSnapshot`
   - Share extension encrypts files with vault key → StagedImportManager stores to app group container → ImportIngestor decrypts with vault key → VaultStorage re-encrypts with master key
   - `CryptoEngine.encryptFileStreamingToHandle` for files > 1MB threshold, single-shot for smaller
   - `AsyncThumbnailView` uses `ThumbnailCache` (NSCache, actor-based) to lazily decrypt thumbnails with masterKey
   - Share extension only generates thumbnails for images via CGImageSource, NOT for videos
   - `PendingImportBanner` shows in VaultView toolbar area when `appState.hasPendingImports` is true
   - VaultBackground color asset referenced as `Color.vaultBackground` with `.ignoresSafeArea()` for full-screen coverage
   - TestFlight deployment via `asc` CLI tool (App Store Connect CLI)

3. Files and Code Sections:

   - **`apps/ios/Vault/Core/Storage/ImportIngestor.swift`** — Core fix for both bugs
     - Added `failureReason: String?` to ImportResult struct for error propagation
     - Changed `processBatch` return to include failureReason
     - Added thumbnail generation fallback for files missing thumbnails (images via FileUtilities, videos via AVAssetImageGenerator)
     - Added imports: `AVFoundation`, `CoreMedia`, `UIKit`
     ```swift
     struct ImportResult {
         let imported: Int
         let failed: Int
         let batchesCleaned: Int
         let failureReason: String?
     }
     ```
     ```swift
     // In processBatch, after thumbnail decryption check:
     if thumbnailData == nil {
         thumbnailData = await generateThumbnail(for: tempURL, mimeType: file.mimeType)
     }
     ```
     ```swift
     private static func generateThumbnail(for fileURL: URL, mimeType: String) async -> Data? {
         if mimeType.hasPrefix("image/") {
             return FileUtilities.generateThumbnail(fromFileURL: fileURL)
         } else if mimeType.hasPrefix("video/") {
             let asset = AVAsset(url: fileURL)
             let generator = AVAssetImageGenerator(asset: asset)
             generator.appliesPreferredTrackTransform = true
             generator.maximumSize = CGSize(width: 400, height: 400)
             let time = CMTime(seconds: 0.5, preferredTimescale: 600)
             guard let cgImage = try? generator.copyCGImage(at: time, actualTime: nil) else { return nil }
             return UIImage(cgImage: cgImage).jpegData(compressionQuality: 0.7)
         }
         return nil
     }
     ```

   - **`apps/ios/Vault/Features/VaultViewer/VaultView+Actions.swift`** — Error handling fixes for all import paths
     - `importPendingFiles()` rewritten: reentrancy guard, idle timer, resets `isImportingPendingFiles`, shows toast on failure, keeps banner visible on failure
     ```swift
     func importPendingFiles() {
         guard !isImportingPendingFiles else { return }
         guard let vaultKey = appState.currentVaultKey else { return }
         isImportingPendingFiles = true
         UIApplication.shared.isIdleTimerDisabled = true
         Task {
             let result = await ImportIngestor.processPendingImports(for: vaultKey)
             await MainActor.run {
                 isImportingPendingFiles = false
                 UIApplication.shared.isIdleTimerDisabled = false
                 if result.imported > 0 {
                     appState.hasPendingImports = false
                     appState.pendingImportCount = 0
                     loadFiles()
                     // ... success haptic + toast
                 } else if result.failed > 0 {
                     toastMessage = .importFailed(result.failed, imported: 0, reason: result.failureReason)
                     // ... error haptic, banner stays visible for retry
                 } else {
                     appState.hasPendingImports = false
                     appState.pendingImportCount = 0
                 }
             }
         }
     }
     ```
     - `performFileImport` now tracks `failedCount` and `lastErrorReason`, shows `.importFailed` toast on failures (was silently swallowing all errors)
     - `handleCapturedImage` catch block changed from `// Handle error silently` to showing error toast:
     ```swift
     } catch {
         await MainActor.run {
             self.toastMessage = .importFailed(1, imported: 0, reason: error.localizedDescription)
         }
     }
     ```

   - **`apps/ios/Vault/UI/Components/PendingImportBanner.swift`** — Fixed stuck spinner
     - Changed `@State private var isImporting` to `@Binding var isImporting` so parent controls state
     ```swift
     struct PendingImportBanner: View {
         let fileCount: Int
         let onImport: () -> Void
         @Binding var isImporting: Bool
         // ... rest unchanged
     }
     ```

   - **`apps/ios/Vault/Features/VaultViewer/VaultView.swift`** — Added state for import banner
     - Added `@State var isImportingPendingFiles = false` at line 126

   - **`apps/ios/Vault/Features/VaultViewer/VaultView+Toolbar.swift`** — Updated banner call site
     ```swift
     PendingImportBanner(
         fileCount: appState.pendingImportCount,
         onImport: { importPendingFiles() },
         isImporting: $isImportingPendingFiles
     )
     ```

   - **`apps/ios/Vault/Features/Settings/SettingsView.swift`** — Background fixes
     - Added `.background(Color.vaultBackground.ignoresSafeArea())` to DuressSetupSheet (after `.toolbar{}` inside NavigationStack)
     - Added `.background(Color.vaultBackground.ignoresSafeArea())` to RestoreFromBackupView Group (before `.navigationTitle`)

   - **`apps/ios/Vault/Core/Billing/PaywallTrigger.swift`** — Background fix
     - Changed `.background(Color.vaultBackground)` to `.background(Color.vaultBackground.ignoresSafeArea())`

   - **`apps/ios/VaultTests/ImportIngestorTests.swift`** — New test file (24 tests)
     - Tests ImportResult fields, failure reason propagation, missing files, thumbnail decryption/round-trip, empty batches, wrong keys, corrupted data, toast message formatting, retry behavior, thumbnail generation fallback

   - **`apps/ios/Vault.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj`** — Updated with new test file refs (TS0000036/TS0000037) and build number 39

   - **Background color fixes from prior session** (committed this session):
     - OnboardingView.swift, PermissionsView.swift, AnalyticsConsentView.swift, ThankYouView.swift, PaywallStepView.swift, VaultView.swift, LoadingView.swift, SharedVaultInviteView.swift, ShareVaultView.swift — all added `.background(Color.vaultBackground.ignoresSafeArea())`

4. Errors and Fixes:
   - **`cannot find 'failed' in scope`** (ImportIngestor.swift line 45): After changing processBatch to return named tuple `batchResult`, the old bare `failed` reference wasn't updated. Fixed by changing `if failed == 0` to `if batchResult.failed == 0`.
   - **Export archive "Failed to Use Accounts"**: xcodebuild -exportArchive failed when ExportOptions.plist had `<key>destination</key><string>upload</string>`. Fixed by creating a separate ExportLocal.plist without the destination key, exporting the IPA locally, then uploading via `asc builds upload`.
   - **Wrong app ID for asc upload**: Used old ID 6741125727, got "not a valid ID" error. Fixed by running `asc apps list` to find correct ID 6758529311.
   - **`asc groups list` unknown command**: The `asc` CLI doesn't have a `groups` subcommand. Need to use `asc testflight` or `asc publish testflight` instead. This was the last action before summary was requested.

5. Problem Solving:
   - **Bug 1 (Free tier silent failure)**: Fully solved. Root cause was `importPendingFiles()` unconditionally hiding banner and never checking `result.failed`. Fix: show error toast, keep banner visible, add failure reason to ImportResult.
   - **Bug 2 (Broken thumbnails)**: Fully solved. Root cause was share extension only generating thumbnails for images, not videos. Fix: ImportIngestor now generates thumbnails for any file missing one using the decrypted temp file.
   - **Background consistency**: Fully solved. Comprehensive audit of all 51 SwiftUI views found 12 total needing fixes (9 from prior session + 3 this session). All fixed and verified.
   - **Additional HIGH bugs found and fixed**: PendingImportBanner stuck spinner, performFileImport silent errors, handleCapturedImage silent errors.
   - **Known unfixed MEDIUM bugs** (documented but not fixed): partial batch retry causing duplicates, ImportIngestor loading entire file into memory, share extension bypassing 100-file free tier limit.

6. All User Messages:
   - (From prior session, carried over in summary) "Once again, lots of screens have default black background. In dark mode the only background allowed should be the one from image 6..."
   - (From prior session) "When adding files while in free version, there is some kind of weird issue. I added 25 files which maybe pushes some type over the limit (or some other reason). I click import and nothing happens... When I switch to paid and do it again all files that are loaded are broken... Investigate and fix it"
   - "I want you to verify that all screens match the same style guide and that you caught all bugs possible and that you wrote extensive tests preventing these bugs in the future. When done, push to testflight"

7. Pending Tasks:
   - **Complete TestFlight distribution**: Build 39 is uploaded and VALID on App Store Connect, but has not been added to a TestFlight beta group yet. The `asc groups list` command failed; need to use `asc testflight` or `asc publish testflight` instead.
   - **Session close protocol**: Need to run `bd sync`, push final state, update scratch pad.

8. Current Work:
   Build 39 was successfully uploaded to App Store Connect and is in VALID status. The last action was trying to list TestFlight groups to add the build, but `asc groups list` is not a valid command. Need to use `asc testflight` or `asc publish testflight` to distribute to TestFlight testers.

   Git status: All code changes committed and pushed. Build number bump (39) committed and pushed. Three commits made this session:
   1. `12f5f4c` - Add VaultBackground to 9 screens missing consistent background color
   2. `083dc57` - Fix silent import failure and missing thumbnails from share extension
   3. `674f0f3` - Harden import error handling, fix remaining backgrounds, add regression tests
   4. `5979950` - Bump build number to 39 for TestFlight

9. Optional Next Step:
   Complete TestFlight distribution of build 39. The user explicitly asked: "When done, push to testflight." Build 39 is uploaded and VALID but not yet distributed to testers. Use `asc publish testflight --app 6758529311 --ipa /tmp/VaultExport/Vault.ipa` or `asc testflight` subcommands to add build to a beta testing group. Then run session close protocol (`bd sync`, verify git push, update scratch pad).

If you need specific details from before compaction (like exact code snippets, error messages, or content you generated), read the full transcript at: /Users/nan/.REDACTED.jsonl
Please continue the conversation from where we left off without asking the user any further questions. Continue with the last task that you were asked to work on.

Here are a lots of minor bugs. I use red rectangles to denominate the areas.

Image 7, the background of this section is diferfent from the ones above. Normalize them (use the one above for the one in rectangle)

Image 8, and image 9, the recovery phrase screen is still not fixed. In both light and dark they have the wrong structure. Match this to the color scheme and the same style as the other versions of this screen

Image 10, the import fails on free version due to the expansion. Expansion shouldn't be a premium feature. The limits of premium are on amount of files not their size. Fix this

Look at this video, /Users/nan/Downloads/ScreenRecording_02-15-2026\ 00-04-37_1.MP4, the system appearance is still not working

Image 11, the x button on this screen is not great. Instead put the word "skip" to the right of the line at the top (move the line a bit). Remove ths kip from the bottom

Fix these. Run all tests. Make sure every screen is unified and adheres to the guidelines.

When done, push to testflight

This session is being continued from a previous conversation that ran out of context. The summary below covers the earlier portion of the conversation.

Analysis:
Let me chronologically analyze the conversation:

**Prior Session Context (from summary):**
- Background color consistency fixes were completed across 12 screens
- Two import bugs were fixed: silent failure on free tier and broken thumbnails from share extension
- PendingImportBanner stuck spinner was fixed
- performFileImport and handleCapturedImage silent error handling was fixed
- 24 regression tests were written in ImportIngestorTests.swift
- Build 39 was uploaded to App Store Connect and was VALID
- The session was interrupted while trying to distribute build 39 to TestFlight groups

**Current Session - Part 1: Completing TestFlight Distribution**
1. Found the correct `asc testflight` command to list beta groups
2. Listed two TestFlight groups: "peps" (internal, auto-access) and "Internal Testers"
3. Got build 39 ID: `15695a4e-d580-42e1-b69b-3556bac8306e`
4. Attempted to add build to both groups - failed because "peps" is internal with hasAccessToAllBuilds
5. Successfully added build to "Internal Testers" group only
6. Pushed remaining commit, synced beads, verified git status clean

**Current Session - Part 2: New User Request with Multiple Bugs**

The user provided 5 screenshots/video with issues:
1. **Image 7**: Empty state third card "Only you can access" has different background from cards above
2. **Images 8 & 9**: Recovery phrase screen has wrong background in both dark and light mode
3. **Image 10**: Import fails on free version with "Storage expansion requires premium" - expansion shouldn't be premium
4. **Video**: System appearance mode still not working (doesn't follow device changes)
5. **Image 11**: Paywall X button should be replaced with "Skip" to the right of progress line, remove bottom Skip

**Current Session - Part 3: Research Phase**

Launched 5 parallel Explore agents to investigate each issue:

1. **Empty state cards agent**: Found all three cards use identical `.vaultGlassBackground(cornerRadius: 12)` in `VaultView+Grid.swift`. On iOS 26+ this uses glass effect which adapts to background content, potentially causing visual differences.

2. **Recovery phrase agent**: Found `RecoveryPhraseInputView` in `PatternLockView.swift` (lines 228-333). The TextEditor uses `Color.vaultSurface` background. The screen has `.background(Color.vaultBackground.ignoresSafeArea())` on the NavigationStack but the content inside isn't getting the proper background.

3. **Blob expansion agent**: Found 3 locations in `VaultStorage.swift` where `SubscriptionManager.isPremiumSnapshot` gates blob expansion (storeFile, storeFiles, storeFileFromURL). The error `expansionNotAllowed` returns "Storage expansion requires premium".

4. **Paywall agent**: Found `VaultairePaywallView.swift` has X button in toolbar, `PaywallStepView.swift` has Skip button at bottom, `OnboardingView.swift` has progress bar that needs Skip added.

5. **Appearance mode agent**: Found root cause - `refreshSystemAppearance()` is only called on app activation and mode change. When system appearance changes while app is in foreground, nothing triggers a refresh. The `resolvedSystemScheme` approach defeats the purpose of "system" mode.

**Current Session - Part 4: Implementation Phase**

Created 6 tasks (#98-#103).

**Fix 1 - Card background (Task #98, completed):**
- File: `VaultView+Grid.swift`
- Changed `.vaultGlassBackground(cornerRadius: 12)` to explicit `.background(Color.vaultSurface).clipShape(RoundedRectangle(cornerRadius: 12))` in walkthroughCard function
- This ensures consistent rendering regardless of iOS version or surrounding content

**Fix 2 - Recovery phrase screen (Task #99, completed):**
- File: `PatternLockView.swift` (RecoveryPhraseInputView)
  - Added `.frame(maxWidth: .infinity, maxHeight: .infinity)` and `.background(Color.vaultBackground)` to VStack content
  - Added `.toolbarBackground(Color.vaultBackground, for: .navigationBar)` and `.toolbarBackground(.visible, for: .navigationBar)`
- File: `VaultSettingsView.swift` (CustomRecoveryPhraseInputView)
  - Same fixes: added `.frame(maxWidth: .infinity, maxHeight: .infinity)`, `.background(Color.vaultBackground)`, toolbar background modifiers
  - Added `.background(Color.vaultBackground.ignoresSafeArea())` on the NavigationStack

**Fix 3 - Remove premium gate from blob expansion (Task #100, completed):**
- File: `VaultStorage.swift`
  - Removed `SubscriptionManager.isPremiumSnapshot` guard from `storeFile()` (was lines 679-684)
  - Removed `SubscriptionManager.isPremiumSnapshot` guard from `storeFiles()` (was lines 806-808)
  - Removed `SubscriptionManager.isPremiumSnapshot` guard from `storeFileFromURL()` (was lines 911-913)
  - Changed error message from "Storage expansion requires premium" to "Unable to expand storage"
- File: `ImportIngestorTests.swift`
  - Updated test strings from "Storage expansion requires premium" to "Unable to expand storage"

**Fix 4 - System appearance mode (Task #101, completed):**
- File: `VaultApp.swift`
  - Removed `resolvedSystemScheme` property
  - Simplified `effectiveColorScheme` to return `appearanceMode.preferredColorScheme` (nil for system mode, letting iOS handle it natively)
  - Removed `refreshSystemAppearance()` method entirely
  - Removed `.onChange(of: scenePhase)` handler that called refreshSystemAppearance
  - Removed `appState.refreshSystemAppearance()` call from `.onAppear`
  - Removed `refreshSystemAppearance()` call from `setAppearanceMode()`

**Fix 5 - Paywall Skip button (Task #102, completed):**
- File: `VaultairePaywallView.swift`
  - Removed the `.toolbar` modifier with the X button
  - Added `var showDismissButton: Bool = true` parameter (for non-onboarding context)
  - BUT: didn't finish adding the conditional toolbar back for when showDismissButton is true
- File: `PaywallStepView.swift`
  - Removed bottom Skip button and VStack wrapper, body now just returns `VaultairePaywallView(onDismiss: onContinue)`
- File: `OnboardingView.swift`
  - Added "Skip" button to the right of progress bar capsule, visible only on `.paywall` step
  - Changed HStack spacing from 4 to 8

**CRITICAL INCOMPLETE WORK:**
The VaultairePaywallView `showDismissButton` parameter was added but the toolbar with conditional X button was NOT re-added. This means:
- In onboarding: Skip is in progress bar (correct)
- In premium gate fullScreenCover: NO way to dismiss! (BUG)

The last edit added `var showDismissButton: Bool = true` to VaultairePaywallView but the toolbar code that conditionally shows the X button based on this parameter was NOT implemented. The `.toolbar` block was completely removed and not conditionally added back.

Also, `PaywallStepView` should pass `showDismissButton: false` when creating VaultairePaywallView.

**Task #103 (Run all tests, build, push to TestFlight) is still in_progress but work hasn't started on it.**

Summary:
1. Primary Request and Intent:
   The user provided 5 bug reports with screenshots/video and asked to fix all of them, run all tests, ensure every screen is unified, and push to TestFlight:
   - **Image 7**: Empty state third card "Only you can access" has a different background from the two cards above it. User said "Normalize them (use the one above for the one in rectangle)"
   - **Images 8 & 9**: Recovery phrase input screen has wrong background in both dark mode (black instead of dark navy) and light mode (white instead of lavender). User said "Match this to the color scheme and the same style as the other versions of this screen"
   - **Image 10**: Free tier import fails with "Storage expansion requires premium". User said "Expansion shouldn't be a premium feature. The limits of premium are on amount of files not their size"
   - **Video** (`/Users/nan/Downloads/ScreenRecording_02-15-2026 00-04-37_1.MP4`): System appearance mode still not working - doesn't follow device appearance changes in real-time
   - **Image 11**: Paywall X button should be replaced with "Skip" text to the right of the progress line at top, and Skip should be removed from the bottom
   - Final instruction: "Fix these. Run all tests. Make sure every screen is unified and adheres to the guidelines. When done, push to testflight"

2. Key Technical Concepts:
   - iOS SwiftUI app with `@Observable` pattern (iOS 17+)
   - VaultBackground color: dark navy #20233C in dark mode, lavender #D1D1E9 in light mode
   - VaultSurface color: #323444 in dark mode, #FFFFFE in light mode (fully opaque)
   - `vaultGlassBackground` modifier: glass effect on iOS 26+, solid Color.vaultSurface on earlier
   - Blob storage: 50MB default blob, expansion creates additional 50MB blobs
   - Free tier limits: 100 photos, 10 videos, 5 vaults (file count based, NOT storage based)
   - `AppAppearanceMode` enum with system/light/dark modes
   - `preferredColorScheme()` SwiftUI modifier: nil = follow system, non-nil = force specific scheme
   - `window.overrideUserInterfaceStyle = .unspecified` for UIKit system mode
   - TestFlight distribution via `asc` CLI tool
   - Build 39 already deployed; build 40 will be needed for next deployment

3. Files and Code Sections:

   - **`/Users/nan/Work/ai/vault/apps/ios/Vault/Features/VaultViewer/VaultView+Grid.swift`**
     - Contains empty state walkthrough cards that user reported as having mismatched backgrounds
     - Changed walkthroughCard from `.vaultGlassBackground(cornerRadius: 12)` to explicit solid background:
     ```swift
     .padding(14)
     .background(Color.vaultSurface)
     .clipShape(RoundedRectangle(cornerRadius: 12))
     .accessibilityElement(children: .combine)
     ```

   - **`/Users/nan/Work/ai/vault/apps/ios/Vault/Features/PatternLock/PatternLockView.swift`**
     - Contains `RecoveryPhraseInputView` (lines 228-333) which had black/white background instead of VaultBackground
     - Fixed by adding background and toolbar background to content inside NavigationStack:
     ```swift
     .padding()
     .frame(maxWidth: .infinity, maxHeight: .infinity)
     .background(Color.vaultBackground)
     .navigationTitle("Recovery")
     .navigationBarTitleDisplayMode(.inline)
     .toolbarBackground(Color.vaultBackground, for: .navigationBar)
     .toolbarBackground(.visible, for: .navigationBar)
     .toolbar {
         ToolbarItem(placement: .cancellationAction) {
             Button("Cancel") { dismiss() }
                 .accessibilityIdentifier("unlock_recovery_cancel")
         }
     }
     ```
     - Outer NavigationStack still has `.background(Color.vaultBackground.ignoresSafeArea())`

   - **`/Users/nan/Work/ai/vault/apps/ios/Vault/Features/Settings/VaultSettingsView.swift`**
     - Contains `CustomRecoveryPhraseInputView` (starts at line 940) with same background issue
     - Applied same fix: added `.frame(maxWidth: .infinity, maxHeight: .infinity)`, `.background(Color.vaultBackground)`, toolbar background modifiers
     - Added `.background(Color.vaultBackground.ignoresSafeArea())` on the NavigationStack (was missing)

   - **`/Users/nan/Work/ai/vault/apps/ios/Vault/Core/Storage/VaultStorage.swift`**
     - Removed premium gate from blob expansion in 3 locations:
     - `storeFile()`: Removed `guard SubscriptionManager.isPremiumSnapshot` (was lines 679-684)
     - `storeFiles()`: Removed `guard SubscriptionManager.isPremiumSnapshot` (was lines 806-808)
     - `storeFileFromURL()`: Removed `guard SubscriptionManager.isPremiumSnapshot` (was lines 911-913)
     - Changed error description: `case .expansionNotAllowed: return "Unable to expand storage"` (was "Storage expansion requires premium")
     - All three locations now just expand automatically without premium check

   - **`/Users/nan/Work/ai/vault/apps/ios/Vault/App/VaultApp.swift`**
     - Fixed system appearance mode by simplifying to let iOS handle it natively
     - Removed `resolvedSystemScheme` property and `refreshSystemAppearance()` method
     - Simplified `effectiveColorScheme`:
     ```swift
     var effectiveColorScheme: ColorScheme? {
         appearanceMode.preferredColorScheme
     }
     ```
     - `AppAppearanceMode.preferredColorScheme` returns nil for .system (follows device), .light/.dark for explicit
     - Removed onChange(of: scenePhase) handler and refreshSystemAppearance calls
     - `.onAppear` now only calls `applyAppearanceToAllWindows()`

   - **`/Users/nan/Work/ai/vault/apps/ios/Vault/Core/Billing/VaultairePaywallView.swift`**
     - Removed the `.toolbar` block with X button entirely
     - Added `var showDismissButton: Bool = true` parameter
     - **IMPORTANT: The conditional toolbar re-addition was NOT completed** - the toolbar needs to be added back when `showDismissButton == true` for the non-onboarding context

   - **`/Users/nan/Work/ai/vault/apps/ios/Vault/Features/Onboarding/PaywallStepView.swift`**
     - Removed bottom Skip button and VStack wrapper:
     ```swift
     var body: some View {
         VaultairePaywallView(onDismiss: onContinue)
     }
     ```
     - **IMPORTANT: Should pass `showDismissButton: false`** but this wasn't done yet

   - **`/Users/nan/Work/ai/vault/apps/ios/Vault/Features/Onboarding/OnboardingView.swift`**
     - Added "Skip" button to the right of progress bar, only on paywall step:
     ```swift
     if currentStep == .paywall {
         Button("Skip") { advance() }
             .font(.subheadline.weight(.medium))
             .foregroundStyle(.vaultSecondaryText)
             .accessibilityIdentifier("paywall_skip")
     }
     ```
     - Changed HStack spacing from 4 to 8

   - **`/Users/nan/Work/ai/vault/apps/ios/VaultTests/ImportIngestorTests.swift`**
     - Updated error message strings from "Storage expansion requires premium" to "Unable to expand storage" (replace_all)

   - **`/Users/nan/Work/ai/vault/apps/ios/Vault/UI/Theme/VaultTheme.swift`** (read only)
     - `vaultGlassBackground`: iOS 26+ uses `.glassEffect(.regular)`, earlier uses `Color.vaultSurface`
     - VaultSurface: dark mode RGB(0.196, 0.204, 0.267) = #323444, fully opaque

   - **`/Users/nan/Work/ai/vault/apps/ios/Vault/Core/Billing/PaywallTrigger.swift`** (read only)
     - Contains `PremiumFeature.expandedStorage` enum case and `FallbackPaywallView`
     - `expandedStorage` still exists in enum but is never triggered now

   - **`/Users/nan/Work/ai/vault/apps/ios/Vault/Core/Billing/SubscriptionManager.swift`** (referenced)
     - `canExpandStorage()` method still exists (returns isPremium) but is no longer called
     - `isPremiumSnapshot` still exists but no longer used in VaultStorage

4. Errors and Fixes:
   - **TestFlight group assignment error**: `asc builds add-groups` failed for "peps" group with "Cannot add internal group to a build" because internal groups with hasAccessToAllBuilds automatically get all builds. Fixed by only adding to "Internal Testers" group.
   - **SourceKit diagnostics**: Multiple "Cannot find X in scope" warnings appeared after edits to VaultStorage.swift, VaultApp.swift, VaultSettingsView.swift, etc. These are SourceKit indexing issues, not actual build errors - they occur because SourceKit can't resolve cross-file references in real-time.
   - **Incomplete VaultairePaywallView fix**: The X button toolbar was removed but the conditional re-addition for non-onboarding contexts was NOT completed. This is a critical incomplete item.

5. Problem Solving:
   - **Card background mismatch**: Root cause was `vaultGlassBackground` using glass effect on iOS 26+ which adapts to background content. Solved by using explicit solid `Color.vaultSurface` background.
   - **Recovery phrase screen background**: NavigationStack's default background was overriding the VaultBackground. Solved by applying background inside NavigationStack on the content VStack and setting toolbar background explicitly.
   - **Storage expansion premium gate**: Three locations in VaultStorage.swift gated blob expansion behind `SubscriptionManager.isPremiumSnapshot`. Solved by removing all three guards.
   - **System appearance mode**: `resolvedSystemScheme` was only updated on app activation, not on system appearance changes. Solved by returning nil for system mode, letting SwiftUI/UIKit handle it natively via `preferredColorScheme(nil)` and `overrideUserInterfaceStyle = .unspecified`.
   - **Paywall Skip button**: Partially solved - Skip added to progress bar, bottom Skip removed. But X button dismissal for non-onboarding context is incomplete.

6. All User Messages:
   - "Here are a lots of minor bugs. I use red rectangles to denominate the areas. Image 7, the background of this section is diferfent from the ones above. Normalize them (use the one above for the one in rectangle) Image 8, and image 9, the recovery phrase screen is still not fixed. In both light and dark they have the wrong structure. Match this to the color scheme and the same style as the other versions of this screen Image 10, the import fails on free version due to the expansion. Expansion shouldn't be a premium feature. The limits of premium are on amount of files not their size. Fix this Look at this video, /Users/nan/Downloads/ScreenRecording_02-15-2026\ 00-04-37_1.MP4, the system appearance is still not working Image 11, the x button on this screen is not great. Instead put the word 'skip' to the right of the line at the top (move the line a bit). Remove ths kip from the bottom Fix these. Run all tests. Make sure every screen is unified and adheres to the guidelines. When done, push to testflight"

7. Pending Tasks:
   - **Complete VaultairePaywallView dismiss button**: Add conditional toolbar back for `showDismissButton == true` (non-onboarding paywall still needs X button to dismiss)
   - **Update PaywallStepView**: Pass `showDismissButton: false` to VaultairePaywallView
   - **Run all tests**: Build and run full test suite to verify no regressions
   - **Build and push to TestFlight**: Bump build number to 40, archive, export, upload, distribute
   - **Session close protocol**: git status, git add, bd sync, git commit, git push

8. Current Work:
   Was in the middle of Fix 5 (paywall X button → Skip). The VaultairePaywallView had its toolbar completely removed and a `showDismissButton: Bool = true` parameter was added, but the conditional toolbar was NOT re-added. The last edit was:
   ```swift
   struct VaultairePaywallView: View {
       let onDismiss: () -> Void
       var showDismissButton: Bool = true
       // ... toolbar was completely removed, needs conditional re-addition
   ```
   Task #103 "Run all tests, build, push to TestFlight" is marked in_progress but not started.

9. Optional Next Step:
   Complete the VaultairePaywallView fix by adding the conditional toolbar back:
   - Add `.toolbar { if showDismissButton { ToolbarItem... X button } }` to VaultairePaywallView
   - Update PaywallStepView to pass `showDismissButton: false`
   - Then proceed to build, test, and deploy to TestFlight as requested: "Run all tests. Make sure every screen is unified and adheres to the guidelines. When done, push to testflight"

If you need specific details from before compaction (like exact code snippets, error messages, or content you generated), read the full transcript at: /Users/nan/.REDACTED.jsonl
Please continue the conversation from where we left off without asking the user any further questions. Continue with the last task that you were asked to work on.

If you look at image 12, when I add new content, it adds it under December 31st even though the content is recent. When I close and reopen the vault the content is properly sorted to (see image 13). Fix this! I want content to be sorted live as it's being added to the appropriate times

The extension import doesn't work. It sends the files into the vault fine (no more crashesh) but can't import it (see video /Users/nan/Downloads/ScreenRecording_02-15-2026\ 08-54-41_1.MP4). Additionally the notification that announces waiting files says 13 files (image 14) even though the vault app says 20 (image 15) 

The system appearance setting is still not working. This is the 4th time you are working on it (see video /Users/nan/Downloads/ScreenRecording_02-15-2026\ 08-52-45_1.MP4). I want you to investigate deeply and don't finish until it's actually working.

When you are done, adjust all tests and push to testflight

This session is being continued from a previous conversation that ran out of context. The summary below covers the earlier portion of the conversation.

Analysis:
Let me chronologically analyze the conversation:

**Prior Session Context (from compaction summary):**
- Previous session fixed 5 UI bugs: card backgrounds, recovery phrase screens, blob expansion, appearance mode, paywall skip
- Build 39 was deployed to TestFlight
- The paywall X button fix was incomplete - the toolbar was removed but conditional re-addition wasn't done
- PaywallStepView needed to pass `showDismissButton: false`

**Current Session - Part 1: Completing Previous Work**

1. Read VaultairePaywallView.swift and PaywallStepView.swift to understand current state
2. Fixed VaultairePaywallView by adding conditional toolbar back:
   - Added `.toolbar { if showDismissButton { ToolbarItem... } }` with X button
   - Added `accessibilityIdentifier("paywall_dismiss")`
3. Updated PaywallStepView to pass `showDismissButton: false`
4. Verified all callers: PaywallTrigger.swift uses default `true` (correct for non-onboarding)
5. Built for testing successfully (warnings only in test files, no errors)
6. Ran all 268 tests - all passed, 0 failures
7. Bumped build number from 39 to 40
8. Committed all changes
9. Archived and exported IPA with automatic signing
10. Build 40 uploaded successfully to App Store Connect
11. Found correct app ID was 6758529311 (not 6740592736 which was used initially)
12. Distributed build 40 to "Internal Testers" TestFlight group
13. Pushed code to remote

**Current Session - Part 2: New User Request with 3 Bugs**

User provided 4 images and 2 videos with issues:

1. **Image 12 + 13**: New content appears under "Friday, December 31" instead of proper date. After lock/unlock it sorts correctly.
2. **Video + Images 14/15**: Share extension import doesn't work (spinner stuck), notification says 12 files but app shows 20
3. **Video**: System appearance mode STILL not working (4th attempt)

User instruction: "Fix these. When you are done, adjust all tests and push to testflight"

**Current Session - Part 3: Investigation Phase**

Created 4 tasks (#104-#107):
- #104: Fix live sorting of newly added files
- #105: Fix share extension import and file count mismatch
- #106: Fix system appearance mode (4th attempt)
- #107: Run tests, build, push to TestFlight

Attempted to launch 3 parallel Explore agents but all hit rate limits.

Proceeded with direct investigation, reading key files in parallel:
- VaultStorage.swift (file storage, createdAt handling)
- VaultApp.swift (appearance mode implementation)
- ContentView.swift (app flow, lock behavior)
- ImportIngestor.swift (import processing)
- PendingImportBanner.swift (UI component)
- VaultView.swift (main view, file listing, sorting)
- VaultView+Actions.swift (import actions, file appending)
- ShareViewController.swift (share extension, notification)
- VaultCoreConstants.swift (shared constants)
- StagedImportManager.swift (batch management)
- SecureEnclaveManager.swift (key derivation salt)
- KeyDerivation.swift (PBKDF2 key derivation)
- CryptoEngine.swift (decryptStaged function)

**Bug 1 Analysis (Sorting):**
Found root cause: When files are appended to the in-memory `files` array in VaultView+Actions.swift, the `VaultFileItem` is created WITHOUT `createdAt` parameter. The init defaults to `nil`. In `groupFilesByDate`, nil dates are treated as `.distantPast` which formats as "Friday, December 31" (year 0001). After lock/unlock, `loadFiles()` reads from VaultStorage where `createdAt` IS set (Date() at store time), so dates are correct.

**Bug 1 Fix (completed, task #104):**
Added `createdAt: Date()` to all 5 VaultFileItem append locations in VaultView+Actions.swift:
1. Line 216 - handleCapturedImage (camera capture)
2. Line 314 - performPhotoImport video path
3. Line 358 - performPhotoImport image path
4. Line 532 - performFileImport video path
5. Line 552 - performFileImport file/document path

**Bug 2 Analysis (Import - in progress):**
- Notification count mismatch: notification sends count from ONE share session, banner counts ALL pending files across ALL batches. Multiple share sessions create multiple batches with separate notifications.
- Import failure: Viewed video frames showing spinner stuck at "20 files ready to import" for 45+ seconds without progress.
- Investigated key derivation chain: ShareExtension and main app both use same `KeyDerivation.deriveKey(from:gridSize:)` with device salt from `SecureEnclaveManager` (shared via keychain access group `group.app.vaultaire.ios`).
- Investigated `ImportIngestor.processPendingImports` → `processBatch` → reads encrypted data → `decryptStaged` → writes temp → `storeFileFromURL`
- The import has NO progress feedback (just spinning), and for 20 files could take a long time
- Possible issues: large files loading entirely into memory via `Data(contentsOf:)`, potential OOM, or possible lock contention with `indexLock`

Was in the middle of investigating the import failure root cause when the summary was requested.

**Bug 3 Analysis (Appearance - not yet started):**
Read VaultApp.swift. Current implementation:
- `effectiveColorScheme` returns `nil` for system mode
- `.preferredColorScheme(appState.effectiveColorScheme)` applied at root
- `applyAppearanceToAllWindows()` sets `window.overrideUserInterfaceStyle = .unspecified` for system mode

Hypothesis: `.preferredColorScheme()` and `window.overrideUserInterfaceStyle` conflict with each other. When SwiftUI's `.preferredColorScheme` goes from non-nil to nil, it may not properly reset. Solution would be to remove `.preferredColorScheme` entirely and rely only on UIKit `window.overrideUserInterfaceStyle`.

Also noted that VaultView has `.preferredColorScheme(appState.effectiveColorScheme)` on the settings fullScreenCover.

**Files modified this session:**
1. VaultairePaywallView.swift - Added conditional toolbar with X button
2. PaywallStepView.swift - Pass showDismissButton: false
3. VaultView+Actions.swift - Added createdAt: Date() to 5 file append locations
4. Vault.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj - Build number 39→40

**Files read but not yet modified for bugs 2 and 3:**
- ImportIngestor.swift, StagedImportManager.swift, ShareViewController.swift, KeyDerivation.swift, SecureEnclaveManager.swift, CryptoEngine.swift, VaultApp.swift, ContentView.swift, VaultView.swift, VaultCoreConstants.swift, PendingImportBanner.swift

Now let me construct the summary.

Summary:
1. Primary Request and Intent:
   
   **First request (from previous session, completed this session):** Complete the VaultairePaywallView fix where the X button toolbar was removed but not conditionally re-added for non-onboarding contexts. Then build, test, and push build 40 to TestFlight.
   
   **Second request (current, in progress):** Fix 3 bugs:
   - **Sorting bug**: Newly added content appears under "Friday, December 31" instead of correct date. After lock/unlock the sort is correct. User wants live sorting as files are added.
   - **Share extension import broken**: Files transfer via share extension fine but pressing Import in the main app shows a stuck spinner indefinitely. Additionally, notification says 12 files but app banner says 20 files.
   - **System appearance mode (4th attempt)**: System appearance setting STILL doesn't follow device appearance changes. User emphasized: "I want you to investigate deeply and don't finish until it's actually working."
   - Final instruction: "When you are done, adjust all tests and push to testflight"

2. Key Technical Concepts:
   - SwiftUI `@Observable` pattern (iOS 17+) for `AppState`
   - `VaultFileItem` struct with optional `createdAt: Date?` defaulting to nil
   - `groupFilesByDate()` treats nil dates as `.distantPast` (renders as "December 31" year 0001)
   - Share extension stages encrypted files in app group container (`group.app.vaultaire.ios`)
   - `StagedImportManager` manages batch directories with manifest JSON files
   - `ImportIngestor.processPendingImports` decrypts staged files and stores via VaultStorage
   - `KeyDerivation.deriveKey` uses PBKDF2 with device-bound salt from SecureEnclave/Keychain
   - `.preferredColorScheme(nil)` should tell SwiftUI to follow system, but may conflict with `window.overrideUserInterfaceStyle`
   - `window.overrideUserInterfaceStyle = .unspecified` is UIKit's way of following system appearance
   - TestFlight distribution via `asc` CLI tool
   - App ID is `6758529311` (not `6740592736` as previously used)
   - Build numbers: 39 → 40 (current), will need 41 for next deployment

3. Files and Code Sections:

   - **`/Users/nan/Work/ai/vault/apps/ios/Vault/Core/Billing/VaultairePaywallView.swift`**
     - Completed the paywall dismiss button fix from previous session
     - Added conditional toolbar with X button when `showDismissButton == true`:
     ```swift
     .toolbar {
         if showDismissButton {
             ToolbarItem(placement: .cancellationAction) {
                 Button {
                     onDismiss()
                 } label: {
                     Image(systemName: "xmark")
                         .font(.body.weight(.semibold))
                         .foregroundStyle(.vaultSecondaryText)
                 }
                 .accessibilityIdentifier("paywall_dismiss")
             }
         }
     }
     ```

   - **`/Users/nan/Work/ai/vault/apps/ios/Vault/Features/Onboarding/PaywallStepView.swift`**
     - Updated to pass `showDismissButton: false` so onboarding paywall has no X button (Skip is in progress bar instead):
     ```swift
     var body: some View {
         VaultairePaywallView(onDismiss: onContinue, showDismissButton: false)
     }
     ```

   - **`/Users/nan/Work/ai/vault/apps/ios/Vault/Features/VaultViewer/VaultView+Actions.swift`**
     - **Critical fix for sorting bug**: Added `createdAt: Date()` to all 5 locations where VaultFileItem is appended inline
     - Location 1 (~line 216) - `handleCapturedImage`: Added `createdAt: Date()` to camera capture append
     - Location 2 (~line 314) - `performPhotoImport` video path: Added `createdAt: Date()` before `duration: metadata.duration`
     - Location 3 (~line 358) - `performPhotoImport` image path: Added `createdAt: Date()`
     - Location 4 (~line 532) - `performFileImport` video path: Added `createdAt: Date()` before `duration: metadata.duration`
     - Location 5 (~line 552) - `performFileImport` file/document path: Added `createdAt: Date()`
     - Example of the fix pattern:
     ```swift
     // Before:
     self.files.append(VaultFileItem(
         id: fileId, size: imageData.count,
         encryptedThumbnail: encThumb, mimeType: "image/jpeg",
         filename: filename
     ))
     // After:
     self.files.append(VaultFileItem(
         id: fileId, size: imageData.count,
         encryptedThumbnail: encThumb, mimeType: "image/jpeg",
         filename: filename, createdAt: Date()
     ))
     ```

   - **`/Users/nan/Work/ai/vault/apps/ios/Vault/Features/VaultViewer/VaultView.swift`**
     - Read for understanding. Key findings:
     - `groupFilesByDate()` at line 64: `let date = item.createdAt ?? .distantPast` — nil createdAt → December 31 bug
     - `VaultFileItem` init at line 461: `createdAt: Date? = nil` — defaults to nil
     - `importPendingFiles()` at line 121: calls `ImportIngestor.processPendingImports(for: vaultKey)` — no progress feedback
     - Settings fullScreenCover at line 401: `.preferredColorScheme(appState.effectiveColorScheme)` — may need removal for appearance fix

   - **`/Users/nan/Work/ai/vault/apps/ios/Vault/Core/Storage/ImportIngestor.swift`**
     - Read for import failure investigation
     - `processPendingImports` loops through all batches, calls `processBatch` for each
     - `processBatch` reads encrypted file via `StagedImportManager.readEncryptedFile` (loads entire file into Data)
     - Decrypts via `CryptoEngine.decryptStaged(encryptedData, with: vaultKey)` (auto-detects streaming vs single-shot)
     - Writes decrypted data to temp file, then stores via `VaultStorage.shared.storeFileFromURL`
     - No progress callback mechanism — entire import runs before returning result

   - **`/Users/nan/Work/ai/vault/apps/ios/Vault/UI/Components/PendingImportBanner.swift`**
     - Read for understanding. Shows `isImporting` spinner via `@Binding var isImporting: Bool`
     - The `isImporting` binds to `isImportingPendingFiles` in VaultView

   - **`/Users/nan/Work/ai/vault/apps/ios/Vault/Extensions/ShareExtension/ShareViewController.swift`**
     - Read for investigation. Key findings:
     - Notification at line 325-353: `scheduleImportNotification(fileCount: total)` — sends count from ONE share session only
     - Uses `CryptoEngine.encryptFileStreamingToHandle` for encryption
     - Key derived via `KeyDerivation.deriveKey(from: pattern, gridSize: VaultCoreConstants.gridSize)` — same as main app

   - **`/Users/nan/Work/ai/vault/apps/ios/Vault/Core/Storage/StagedImportManager.swift`**
     - Read for investigation. `pendingBatches(for:)` returns ALL batches matching fingerprint — explains count difference between notification (one session) and banner (all batches)

   - **`/Users/nan/Work/ai/vault/apps/ios/Vault/App/VaultApp.swift`**
     - Current appearance implementation:
     ```swift
     .preferredColorScheme(appState.effectiveColorScheme)  // nil for system mode
     .onAppear { appState.applyAppearanceToAllWindows() }
     ```
     - `effectiveColorScheme` returns `appearanceMode.preferredColorScheme` (nil for .system)
     - `applyAppearanceToAllWindows()` sets `window.overrideUserInterfaceStyle` on all windows
     - Hypothesis: `.preferredColorScheme` and `overrideUserInterfaceStyle` conflict — need to remove `.preferredColorScheme` entirely

   - **`/Users/nan/Work/ai/vault/apps/ios/Vault/App/ContentView.swift`**
     - Lock-on-background at line 109-117: `willResignActiveNotification` → `appState.lockVault()` — could cancel long-running imports
     - `onChange(of: appState.currentVaultKey)` at line 299-313: cancels `activeImportTask` on key change — but `importPendingFiles` doesn't use `activeImportTask`

   - **`/Users/nan/Work/ai/vault/apps/ios/Vault/Core/Crypto/KeyDerivation.swift`**
     - Uses `SecureEnclaveManager.shared.getDeviceSalt()` for PBKDF2 salt
     - Share extension uses same derivation (no #if EXTENSION difference in core logic)

   - **`/Users/nan/Work/ai/vault/apps/ios/Vault/Core/Security/SecureEnclaveManager.swift`**
     - Salt stored in keychain with `kSecAttrAccessGroup: "group.app.vaultaire.ios"` — shared with extensions
     - `kSecAttrAccessibleWhenUnlockedThisDeviceOnly` — available when device is unlocked

   - **`/Users/nan/Work/ai/vault/apps/ios/Vault/Core/VaultCoreConstants.swift`**
     - `appGroupIdentifier = "group.app.vaultaire.ios"`
     - `pendingImportsURL` points to app group container + "pending_imports"

   - **`/Users/nan/Work/ai/vault/apps/ios/Vault/Core/Crypto/CryptoEngine.swift`**
     - `decryptStaged` at line 577: auto-detects streaming vs single-shot format
     - `isStreamingFormat` checks for VCSE magic bytes

4. Errors and Fixes:
   - **Stale simulator ID**: Test run failed with "Unable to boot deleted device" for ID 57965726. Fixed by finding booted simulator `6627B57F-5EC5-4AB4-9695-69154B26952D` via `xcrun simctl list devices available`.
   - **Wrong app ID for asc**: Used `6740592736` initially but all build queries returned empty. Ran `asc apps list` and discovered correct ID is `6758529311` ("Vaultaire: Encrypted Vault"). Fixed by using correct app ID for all subsequent asc commands.
   - **ExportOptions.plist missing automatic signing**: First export attempt failed with "requires a provisioning profile" errors. Fixed by using the project's own `/Users/nan/Work/ai/vault/apps/ios/ExportOptions.plist` which has `signingStyle: automatic` and `destination: upload`.
   - **Auth key path for export**: Needed to find the issuer ID for xcodebuild auth. Found it by querying keychain: `security find-generic-password -s 'asc' -a 'asc:credential:Vaultaire' -w` → extracted `issuer_id: 3c53a69e-b7d6-4d46-a26b-2f2d02c69ccb`, key path: `/Users/nan/.private_keys/AuthKey_GGJ9L8Y97B.p8`.
   - **Subagent rate limits**: All 3 Explore agents hit rate limits. Worked around by doing investigation directly in the main context.

5. Problem Solving:
   
   **Solved - Paywall dismiss button**: Added conditional toolbar back to VaultairePaywallView for non-onboarding context (X button visible when `showDismissButton == true`).
   
   **Solved - File sorting (Bug 1)**: Root cause was VaultFileItem appended without `createdAt` → nil → `.distantPast` → "December 31". Fixed by adding `createdAt: Date()` to all 5 append locations.
   
   **In Progress - Import failure (Bug 2)**: Investigation found:
   - Count mismatch is by design: notification = one session count, banner = all batches total
   - Import stuck spinner: ImportIngestor has no progress callback, processes all files sequentially
   - Possible causes: large file memory pressure (Data(contentsOf:) for encrypted files), long processing time for 20 files, or potential lock contention
   - Video confirms spinner runs 45+ seconds without completing or showing error
   - Still need to determine root cause of actual failure vs just slow performance
   
   **Not Started - Appearance mode (Bug 3)**: Analysis complete, hypothesis formed:
   - `.preferredColorScheme()` and `window.overrideUserInterfaceStyle` conflict
   - Fix: Remove all `.preferredColorScheme()` modifiers, rely solely on UIKit `overrideUserInterfaceStyle`
   - Need to remove from: VaultApp body, VaultView settings fullScreenCover
   - Need to ensure `applyAppearanceToAllWindows()` catches new windows from fullScreenCovers

6. All User Messages:
   - (From compaction summary, prior session): "Here are a lots of minor bugs. I use red rectangles to denominate the areas. Image 7, the background of this section is different from the ones above. Normalize them... Image 8, and image 9, the recovery phrase screen is still not fixed... Image 10, the import fails on free version due to the expansion...

7. Pending Tasks:
   - **Task #105 (in_progress)**: Fix share extension import failure and file count mismatch — investigation in progress, root cause not yet confirmed
   - **Task #106 (pending)**: Fix system appearance mode — 4th attempt, deep investigation needed, hypothesis formed but not implemented
   - **Task #107 (pending)**: Run all tests, build, push to TestFlight — after all fixes
   - **Session close protocol**: git status → git add → bd sync → git commit → git push — NOT YET DONE
   - Build number needs to be bumped to 41 for next TestFlight deployment

8. Current Work:
   Was actively investigating Bug 2 (share extension import failure). Had just finished reading `SecureEnclaveManager.swift` to verify the key derivation chain is consistent between the share extension and main app. Confirmed that both use the same keychain access group (`group.app.vaultaire.ios`) and same `KeyDerivation.deriveKey(from:gridSize:)` function.

   The investigation has established:
   - Keys should match between extension and main app (same salt, same derivation)
   - The import video shows a stuck spinner for 45+ seconds
   - `importPendingFiles()` creates a `Task {}` that calls `ImportIngestor.processPendingImports(for:)` with no progress feedback
   - `ImportIngestor.processBatch` reads entire encrypted files into memory via `Data(contentsOf:)`, which could cause OOM for large files
   - The notification count difference (12 vs 20) is expected behavior — notifications reflect individual share sessions while the banner counts all batches

   Bug 1 (sorting) fix is completed. Bug 3 (appearance) has a hypothesis but no implementation yet.

9. Optional Next Step:
   Continue investigating and fixing Bug 2 (import failure). The most likely root causes to investigate are:
   1. Memory pressure from `readEncryptedFile` loading entire files into memory — for 20 files with large videos this could OOM
   2. The `processPendingImports` has no progress indication, making it appear stuck even if working
   3. Need to check if `decryptStaged` properly handles the streaming format used by `encryptFileStreamingToHandle`
   
   After fixing Bug 2, implement Bug 3 fix (remove `.preferredColorScheme` everywhere, rely on UIKit `overrideUserInterfaceStyle` only), then run tests and push build 41 to TestFlight.

   User's exact words: "The extension import doesn't work. It sends the files into the vault fine (no more crashesh) but can't import it" and "The system appearance setting is still not working. This is the 4th time you are working on it... I want you to investigate deeply and don't finish until it's actually working." and "When you are done, adjust all tests and push to testflight"
