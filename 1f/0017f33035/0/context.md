### Prompt 1

Implement the following plan:

# Implement VAULT-4fm + VAULT-d3u: Storage Tests + Error Path Tests

## Context
Two open beads issues need implementation:
- **VAULT-4fm**: VaultStorage has zero integration tests. Need round-trip coverage for core storage operations.
- **VAULT-d3u**: PatternSetupView error paths (key derivation failure, save failure, duplicate pattern) now show alerts but are untestable because the view calls singletons directly.

## Task 1: VaultStorage Integration Tests (VAULT-4...

### Prompt 2

Great. Push it to testflight

### Prompt 3

Ok, I want to start designing the website for this app. I got cloudflare account and domains ready. I got both vaultaire.app and vaultaire.com but only one should be used. I want you to set up cloudflare for them correctly and work on the design of the website so I can publish the app. Let's start with the setup.

We also have other requirement, like privacy policy, terms of use, e...

### Prompt 6

When I open the onboarding flow, once I get to the paywall, I can't select any of the buttons. It actually takes seconds before it starts working.

### Prompt 7

### Prompt 8

It doesn't seem to be related to analytics. I can't still click the button on that screen. Even if I say don't send analytics. It takes literally seconds before the options become clickable.

### Prompt 9

Large files (few hundred mb videos) take a very long time to import. We should do something about that. It's important that the speed of "upload" to a vault is as fast as possible.

for a video in the gallery view, we should indicate it's actually a video by displaying time in the bottom right corner (length of the video) like the native photos app does it.

To load a video takes a very very long time. This is a 3min video that is 500MB of size. I don't even know if it loads because I gave up on...
