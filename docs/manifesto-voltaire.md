# A Treatise on the Concealment of Private Papers in an Age of Tyrants

### Being a Defence of the Art of Disappearance, by One Who Has Known the Inside of the Bastille

---

It is a curious defect of our time that those who construct vaults announce them as vaults. They affix great iron locks to the door and wonder why the magistrate demands the key. They paint the word *SECRET* upon the lid and are astonished when the customs officer pries it open.

I have had occasion, in my long quarrel with the powerful, to observe that the safest letter is not the one sealed with wax — it is the one that appears never to have been written.

**Vaultaire does not conceal your papers behind a gate. It abolishes the gate, the wall, and every trace that a room once stood there at all.**

## On the Mechanism

Trace a figure upon the glass — a gesture, nothing more — and a chamber opens, containing your private documents, each rendered into cipher. Trace a different figure, and an entirely different chamber appears, with different documents, different ciphers, different keys. Furnish the wrong figure, and you receive no rebuke, no protestation, no indication of error. You receive merely an empty room. And here is the genius of the design: **an empty room and a wrong gesture are, to the observer, perfectly indistinguishable.**

The whole of your archive rests within a block of mathematical noise, arranged so that whether it contains nothing or everything, it presents the same face to the world. The most learned examiner, equipped with the finest instruments of the age, cannot determine whether substance lurks within.

This is not a lock upon a cabinet. This is the absence of the cabinet itself.

## On the Necessity of Such an Instrument

I have written before that to discover to whom power truly belongs in a society, one need only ask whom it is forbidden to question. Let me add a corollary: **to discover who is truly free, ask who may keep a secret without explaining why.**

The journalist who guards a source. The dissident who carries evidence of what the state has done. The woman who preserves proof of what has been done to her, upon a device her tormentor inspects each evening. The traveller who crosses a frontier where the officer's courtesy extends precisely as far as his curiosity. The advocate whose duty to a client is sacred, yet whose pocket holds a device that any magistrate may seize.

For these souls, privacy is not the luxury of the guilty. It is the last fortification of the innocent.

## On the Principle of Duress

Here the makers of Vaultaire have devised something worthy of a chapter in *Candide*:

Designate any chamber as a trap. When the figure for that chamber is drawn — under compulsion, under threat, under the hard gaze of authority — every other chamber is silently and irrevocably destroyed. The trap-chamber opens as though nothing has occurred. The officer, the interrogator, the brute, sees a cooperating subject and an unremarkable archive. He has no means of knowing that anything else ever existed, because in the strictest sense, it no longer does.

One is reminded of the wisdom of those who, upon hearing the inquisitor's knock, did not hide the manuscript in the chimney but fed it to the fire and set a pot of soup above the ashes.

## On What Has Been Refused

The builders of this instrument have exercised a discipline rarer than invention: **the discipline of refusal.**

They have refused the reading of the face and the pressing of the thumb — for these can be compelled by any bailiff with sufficient authority or sufficient muscle. They have refused the cloud — for what ascends to a server descends, in time, to a subpoena. They have refused the account — for an identity is a leash, and a leash has two ends. They have refused the backdoor dressed as *account recovery* — for a door that opens for the owner opens also for the thief, and it is only a matter of who arrives first.

They have refused, in short, every compromise that would make the instrument more convenient and less free.

## A Closing Remark

I have spent the better portion of my life arguing that the right to private thought is the foundation upon which every other liberty is constructed. Without it, speech is performance, worship is obedience, and assembly is merely the gathering of the surveilled.

Vaultaire does not ask you to trust a company, a server, or a government. It asks you to remember a shape drawn by your own hand. That is all. And that — in an age when every device in your pocket reports to someone — is a revolutionary act.

**Your papers deserve better than a lock that announces itself. They deserve to vanish.**
