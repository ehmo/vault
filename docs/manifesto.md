# The Case for Vaultaire

## Privacy apps have a fatal flaw: they look like privacy apps.

A locked folder announces it's locked. A hidden gallery called "Calculator+" fools no one who's looking. Every "secure" app on your phone shares the same problem — it proves you have something to hide.

When someone forces you to unlock your phone — a border agent, an abusive partner, an authoritarian regime — they see the app, they see the lock, and they don't stop until you open it.

Vaultaire doesn't hide your files behind a lock. It makes them **cease to exist**.

## How

Draw a pattern. A vault opens. Draw a different pattern — a completely different vault opens, with different files, different encryption keys, different everything. Enter the wrong pattern? No error message. No "incorrect password." Just an empty vault. There is no observable difference between "wrong" and "empty."

Every vault sits inside a pre-allocated block of encrypted noise. Whether you've stored zero files or five hundred, the data on disk looks identical. Forensic tools cannot tell the difference. There is nothing to find because there is nothing that looks like something to find.

This is not a lock on a door. This is a wall where the door used to be.

## Why it matters

Privacy is not a feature you bolt onto an app. It's a property of the architecture. Vaultaire was designed from the ground up around a single principle: **no one — not us, not Apple, not a forensic examiner — can prove your files exist.**

- **No accounts.** No email, no phone number, no identity. There is nothing to subpoena.
- **No cloud.** Your files never leave your device unless you explicitly choose to share them. When you do, they're encrypted before upload. The server sees noise.
- **No biometrics.** Face ID can be compelled by law. A pattern in your head cannot be extracted. This is a deliberate choice.
- **No "forgot password."** There is no server that knows your pattern. No email reset. No backdoor. Recovery phrases exist for those who want them, stored only on-device. But there is no way in for anyone but you.

## For people who need it most

**Journalists** protecting sources where phone searches are routine. **Activists** carrying documentation under surveillance. **Domestic abuse survivors** keeping evidence secure on a monitored device. **Travelers** crossing borders where device inspection is mandatory. **Attorneys** with privileged materials on personal phones.

And anyone who understands that privacy isn't about having something to hide. It's about having something to protect.

## The duress button no one can see

Designate any vault as a duress trigger. When that pattern is drawn under coercion, every other vault is silently destroyed. The duress vault opens normally. The person watching sees cooperation and an ordinary vault. They have no way to know anything else ever existed.

## What we refuse to do

We refuse to add biometric unlock — it can be compelled. We refuse to add cloud sync — it creates a target. We refuse to add analytics that track how you use the app. We refuse to add a backdoor disguised as account recovery. We refuse to weaken the architecture for convenience.

Every decision in Vaultaire optimizes for one thing: **that your files remain yours, and yours alone, under any circumstances.**
