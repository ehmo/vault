Implement the following plan:

# Vertical Drag-to-Select Rows

## Context
Currently drag-to-select only works horizontally (selects individual cells across a row). Vertical drags are rejected (`guard dx > dy`) to allow scrolling. User wants Photos-app-style behavior: dragging vertically selects entire rows (all 3 items per row).

## Changes

**Files**: `PhotosGridView.swift` and `FilesGridView.swift` (identical changes in both)

### 1. Add state
```swift
@State private var isDragVertical = false
```

### 2. Add `rowCellIds(at:)` method (after `cellId(at:)`)
Finds all cells sharing the same row as a given Y coordinate by matching `midY` within 5pt tolerance.

### 3. Modify `dragSelectGesture`
- **Direction gate**: Remove `guard dx > dy`. Accept both directions. Set `isDragVertical = dy > dx`.
- **Start**: If vertical, select entire row at start location. If horizontal, select single cell (current behavior).
- **Continue**: If vertical, select entire row at current location. If horizontal, select single cell.
- **End**: Reset `isDragVertical`.

### Scroll behavior
`.simultaneousGesture` lets both selection and scroll fire. For vertical drags: content scrolls under finger while `value.location.y` (in grid coordinate space) shifts, automatically selecting new rows. Native scrolling doubles as auto-scroll — no extra logic needed.

## Verification
- Build: `xcodebuild build -project apps/ios/Vault.xcodeproj -scheme Vault -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,id=1E2BEFBC-2FBC-49D2-84B5-5DE55338CF79'`
- Test: `xcodebuild test ... -only-testing:VaultTests`
- Manual: enter edit mode → vertical drag → confirm entire rows selected
- Manual: horizontal drag → confirm individual cells still selected
- Manual: tap → confirm single cell toggle still works

Review all code you just written for bugs. Also review other code that can depend on this code and see if there are any issues that could arise from this change. Look for any logical, implementation issues and any edge cases.

Push all to github. Then send it to both phone and testflight

# Xcode Build and Export

Use this skill when you need to build an app from source and prepare it for upload to App Store Connect.

## Preconditions
- Xcode installed and command line tools configured
- Valid signing identity and provisioning profiles (or automatic signing enabled)

## iOS Build Flow

### 1. Clean and Archive
```bash
xcodebuild clean archive \
  -scheme "YourScheme" \
  -configuration Release \
  -archivePath /tmp/YourApp.xcarchive \
  -destination "generic/platform=iOS"
```

### 2. Export IPA
```bash
xcodebuild -exportArchive \
  -archivePath /tmp/YourApp.xcarchive \
  -exportPath /tmp/YourAppExport \
  -exportOptionsPlist ExportOptions.plist \
  -allowProvisioningUpdates
```

A minimal `ExportOptions.plist` for App Store distribution:
```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
<plist version="1.0">
<dict>
    <key>method</key>
    <string>app-store-connect</string>
    <key>teamID</key>
    <string>YOUR_TEAM_ID</string>
</dict>
</plist>
```

### 3. Upload with asc
```bash
asc builds upload --app "APP_ID" --ipa "/tmp/YourAppExport/YourApp.ipa"
```

## macOS Build Flow

### 1. Archive
```bash
xcodebuild archive \
  -scheme "YourMacScheme" \
  -configuration Release \
  -archivePath /tmp/YourMacApp.xcarchive \
  -destination "generic/platform=macOS"
```

### 2. Export PKG
```bash
xcodebuild -exportArchive \
  -archivePath /tmp/YourMacApp.xcarchive \
  -exportPath /tmp/YourMacAppExport \
  -exportOptionsPlist ExportOptions.plist \
  -allowProvisioningUpdates
```

### 3. Upload PKG with asc
macOS apps export as `.pkg` files. Upload with `asc`:
```bash
asc builds upload \
  --app "APP_ID" \
  --pkg "/tmp/YourMacAppExport/YourApp.pkg" \
  --version "1.0.0" \
  --build-number "123"
```

Notes:
- `--pkg` automatically sets platform to `MAC_OS`.
- For `.pkg` uploads, `--version` and `--build-number` are required (they are not auto-extracted like IPA uploads).
- Add `--wait` if you want to wait for build processing to complete.

## Build Number Management

Each upload requires a unique build number higher than previously uploaded builds.

In Xcode project settings:
- `CURRENT_PROJECT_VERSION` - build number (e.g., "316")
- `MARKETING_VERSION` - version string (e.g., "2.2.0")

Check existing builds:
```bash
asc builds list --app "APP_ID" --platform IOS --limit 5
```

## Troubleshooting

### "No profiles for bundle ID" during export
- Add `-allowProvisioningUpdates` flag
- Verify your Apple ID is logged into Xcode

### Build rejected for missing icon (macOS)
macOS requires ICNS format icons with all sizes:
- 16x16, 32x32, 128x128, 256x256, 512x512 (1x and 2x)

### CFBundleVersion too low
The build number must be higher than any previously uploaded build. Increment `CURRENT_PROJECT_VERSION` and rebuild.

## Notes
- Always clean before archive for release builds
- Use `xcodebuild -showBuildSettings` to verify configuration
- For submission issues (encryption, content rights), see `asc-submission-health` skill
