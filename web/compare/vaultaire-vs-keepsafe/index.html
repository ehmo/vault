      <!-- Deep Dive Sections -->
      <section class="compare-section">
        <h2>The Account Requirement Paradox</h2>
        <p>Keepsafe asks you to create an account with your email address before you can use the app. Think about that for a moment: a privacy app that requires personally identifiable information before it will protect your files. Your email is now linked to the fact that you use a photo-hiding app, stored on Keepsafe's servers alongside your usage metadata.</p>
        <p>Vaultaire has no account system. There is no sign-up screen, no email field, no password to create. You draw a pattern, and the app derives an encryption key. The app does not know who you are, and it does not need to.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="compare-section">
        <h2>Cloud Dependency Risks</h2>
        <p>Keepsafe's cloud backup feature stores your photos on their infrastructure. This creates multiple risk vectors: server breaches expose your files, service outages block access, and company shutdown means your data could disappear entirely. Their "military-grade encryption" claim is difficult to verify because the encryption happens on their servers, not your device.</p>
        <p>Vaultaire's backup goes through iCloud, but the files are encrypted on your device before upload. Apple transports encrypted blobs -- they cannot read them, and neither can anyone who compromises iCloud. If you stop using Vaultaire, your recovery phrase lets you decrypt everything locally.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="compare-section">
        <h2>Pricing vs Value</h2>
        <p>Keepsafe Premium costs $9.99/month or $23.99/year. For that price, you get cloud storage on their servers, ad removal, and some additional organizational features. The core security model does not change between free and premium -- both tiers use account-based authentication rather than local encryption.</p>
        <p>Vaultaire Pro costs $1.99/month, $9.99/year, or $29.99 lifetime. The free tier already includes AES-256-GCM encryption -- the same cryptographic standard used by the paid tier. Pro adds unlimited vaults, the duress vault, iCloud backup, and sharing. The security architecture is identical at every price point.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="compare-section">
        <h2>Data Ownership</h2>
        <p>When your photos live on Keepsafe's servers, you are trusting a third party with your most private files. Their privacy policy governs what they can do with your data. If they are acquired, pivot their business model, or receive a legal request, your files are in someone else's hands.</p>
        <p>Vaultaire files never leave your device unless you explicitly enable iCloud backup -- and even then, they are encrypted before upload. There is no third-party server, no terms of service governing your files, and no entity that can access your data without your pattern. You own the encryption keys. You own the data.</p>

          <p class="review-response"><strong>Vaultaire approach:</strong> No account, no email, no phone number. You draw a pattern, and the app works. Zero personally identifiable information collected.</p>

        <div class="review-card">
          <div class="review-complaint">Photos lost when server had issues</div>
          <p class="review-quote">"Their servers went down and I couldn't access my photos for two days. Some never came back."</p>
          <p class="review-response"><strong>Vaultaire approach:</strong> All files are stored locally on your device. No server dependency means no server outages. iCloud backup is optional and encrypted end-to-end.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="review-card">
          <div class="review-complaint">Expensive subscription</div>
          <p class="review-quote">"$9.99 a month for a photo vault? That's $120 a year to hide photos."</p>
          <p class="review-response"><strong>Vaultaire approach:</strong> Pro is $1.99/month or $9.99/year. The lifetime option at $29.99 costs less than three months of Keepsafe Premium. The free tier includes real encryption.</p>
