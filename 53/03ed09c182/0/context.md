Investigate issue with coloring of the app (see video /Users/nan/Downloads/ScreenRecording_02-17-2026\ 10-14-34_1.MP4)>

When I open vault you can see that the app gets recolored, with the top having some kind of weird noticable lag.

When I got to app settings and change appearance, you can visibly see the recoloring happening separately for the top and the rest of the screen.

It's important that either the color changes instantenously or that it's smooth across the whole screen
