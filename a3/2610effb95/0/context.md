## User Prompts

### Prompt 1

Implement the following plan:

# Unified File Operation Progress Overlay

## Context
Two separate progress UIs exist for file operations — one glass card in the empty state (shared vault downloads), one plain overlay (local imports/deletes). The user wants a single unified glass-card modal for ALL file operations, shown as an overlay with a dimmed background so files populating behind it are visible.

## Current State

| Operation | Data Source | UI | Location |
|-----------|-----------|-----|...

### Prompt 2

Review all code you just written for bugs. Also review other code that can depend on this code and see if there are any issues that could arise from this change. Look for any logical, implementation issues and any edge cases.

### Prompt 3

Push to git and then send it to the device for testing

### Prompt 4

When sharing a vault it's a link that is being shared. But in the selector there is no browser. Any reason for that? Can we somehow influence which apps are available?

### Prompt 6

On larger screens the first screen of onboarding is all smushed together (see image). Make it proportional with smaller screens than the default iphone 16 needing to scroll
