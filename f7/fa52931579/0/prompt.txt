I want to clean up and unify all design across the app.

First, the mode of the app, system, dark, light doesn't immediately change the design of the screen. Instead it changes the back screen but not the settings screen. Second I think this should be a menu Settings -> App settings -> Appearance -> System, Dark, Light. And it should change the whole screen instantly.

Also don't push to testflight just yet. I got lots of things I want to fix

---

The "use recovery phrase" screen is all black. The join shared vault screen has all black text area. Set custom recovery phrase screen is completely different. Go through all screens and unify the colors. I want everything to use the structure of the set custom recovery phrase. When you are done, I want you write up brand guidelines, fonts, colors, etc, and adhere to them everywhere.

Also the pixel loader is different in every screen. I want the one from dynamic island be exclusively used everywhere. Same patterns, same colors. Obviously the colors should adjust based on dark or light mode, but otherwise the pixel loader should be exactly the same everywhere

---

Ok, now because we don't use anymore the half cards in join vault and recover with passphrase, I guess we shouldn't use it elsewhere. So maybe we should switch to full screen all screens, including all settings. That means we need buttons at the top. But before we do so, I would like your take on this

---

Ok I agree, let's keep the system sheets what you suggested and change the rest

---

This session is being continued from a previous conversation that ran out of context. The summary below covers the earlier portion of the conversation.

Analysis:
Let me chronologically analyze the conversation:

1. **First user message**: User wants to clean up and unify design across the app. Two specific issues:
   - Appearance mode (system/dark/light) doesn't immediately change the settings screen - only the background changes
   - Wants the appearance setting moved to: Settings -> App Settings -> Appearance -> System/Dark/Light
   - Should change whole screen instantly
   - Don't push to TestFlight yet

2. **My investigation**: Used Explore agents to understand:
   - AppAppearanceMode enum in VaultApp.swift
   - `.preferredColorScheme()` applied at root WindowGroup level
   - Settings presented as `.sheet()` which is separate presentation context
   - PaywallTrigger.swift has hardcoded `.preferredColorScheme(.dark)`

3. **First round of fixes**:
   - Added `.preferredColorScheme(appState.appearanceMode.preferredColorScheme)` to the settings sheet in VaultView.swift
   - Created `AppearanceSettingsView` with System/Dark/Light as checkmark list
   - Replaced segmented picker with NavigationLink in AppSettingsView
   - Built successfully

4. **Second user message**: Major design unification request:
   - "Use recovery phrase" screen is all black
   - Join shared vault screen has all black text area
   - Set custom recovery phrase screen is completely different
   - Go through ALL screens and unify colors to match CustomRecoveryPhraseInputView structure
   - Write brand guidelines (fonts, colors, etc.)
   - Pixel loader is different in every screen - wants Dynamic Island version used everywhere

5. **Comprehensive audit**: Used 3 parallel Explore agents to:
   - Audit ALL views for hardcoded colors
   - Audit ALL pixel loader usages
   - Read specific problem screens

6. **Root cause identified**: The "all black" screens were caused by `.fullScreenCover()` and `.sheet()` not inheriting `.preferredColorScheme()` from the parent view hierarchy. The fix was to use UIKit's `UIWindow.overrideUserInterfaceStyle` globally.

7. **Changes made**:
   - **VaultApp.swift**: Added `applyAppearanceToAllWindows()` method using `UIWindow.overrideUserInterfaceStyle`
   - **PaywallTrigger.swift**: Removed `.preferredColorScheme(.dark)`, replaced `Color.black` with `Color.vaultBackground`, removed hardcoded `.foregroundStyle(.white)`
   - **SecureImageViewer.swift**: Replaced hardcoded black/white with theme tokens
   - **SecureVideoPlayer.swift**: Same treatment
   - **FullScreenPhotoViewer.swift**: Same treatment
   - **ToastView.swift**: Replaced hardcoded colors with `.ultraThinMaterial`
   - **ContentView.swift**: Screenshot overlay uses `Color.vaultBackground`
   - **PixelAnimation.swift**: Fixed default `animationDuration` from 0.25 to 0.3, fixed preview backgrounds
   - **DESIGN.md**: Created brand guidelines document

8. **Build verified**: Clean build, zero warnings

9. **Committed**: "Unify design system: global color scheme, theme-only colors, brand guidelines"

10. **Third user message**: User asks for opinion on switching from half-card sheets to full-screen for all screens

11. **My recommendation**: 
    - Full-screen for settings, multi-step flows, security-critical screens
    - Keep system sheets for camera picker, photo picker
    - Suggested either true `.fullScreenCover` or `.sheet([.large]) + .interactiveDismissDisabled()`

12. **Fourth user message**: "Ok I agree, let's keep the system sheets what you suggested and change the rest"

13. **Current work**: I started reading files to plan the sheet→fullScreenCover conversion:
    - Read RecoveryPhraseView.swift - has NavigationStack ✅
    - Read ShareVaultView.swift (first 50 lines) - has its own header with Cancel button
    - Read VaultView.swift lines 345-405 - identified which sheets to convert

Files to convert from `.sheet()` to `.fullScreenCover()`:
- VaultView.swift: settings (line 396), file viewer (line 382)
- VaultSettingsView.swift: change pattern (158), recovery phrase (162), share vault (165), custom phrase (168)
- SettingsView.swift: duress setup (515), restore from backup (629)
- PaywallTrigger.swift: paywall (29)

Files to KEEP as sheets:
- VaultView.swift: camera (350), photo picker (353)

I also noticed there's a stale `Color.black.ignoresSafeArea()` in VaultView.swift line 379 (inside the photo viewer fullScreenCover else branch).

The conversation was interrupted for this summary before I could start making the actual sheet→fullScreenCover changes.

Summary:
1. Primary Request and Intent:
   The user wants to clean up and unify all design across the Vaultaire iOS app. Specific requests:
   - **Appearance mode fix**: System/Dark/Light mode should change the entire screen instantly, not just the background. Move the setting to Settings → App Settings → Appearance → System/Dark/Light.
   - **Color unification**: All screens should use theme tokens (like CustomRecoveryPhraseInputView does). No hardcoded `Color.black`, `Color.white`, etc. Specific problems: "use recovery phrase" screen is all black, join shared vault screen has all black text area.
   - **Pixel loader unification**: The Dynamic Island pixel loader configuration must be used everywhere — same patterns, same colors, same timing. Colors should adapt to dark/light mode.
   - **Brand guidelines**: Write up a design document covering fonts, colors, pixel loader spec, and usage rules.
   - **Sheet → Full-screen conversion**: Convert most `.sheet()` presentations to `.fullScreenCover()` for consistency. Keep system sheets (camera, photo picker) as-is.
   - **Do NOT push to TestFlight** — user has more things to fix.

2. Key Technical Concepts:
   - **SwiftUI `.preferredColorScheme()` limitation**: Applied at root `WindowGroup` but does NOT propagate to `.sheet()` and `.fullScreenCover()` presentations, which are separate presentation contexts.
   - **UIKit `overrideUserInterfaceStyle` global fix**: Setting `UIWindow.overrideUserInterfaceStyle` on all windows ensures every sheet, fullScreenCover, and alert respects the appearance setting instantly.
   - **Asset catalog color tokens**: `Color.vaultBackground`, `Color.vaultSurface`, `Color.vaultText`, `Color.vaultSecondaryText`, `Color.vaultHighlight`, `Color.accentColor` — all with light/dark variants.
   - **PixelAnimation canonical config**: Pattern `[1,2,3,6,9,8,7,4]` (perimeter walk), brightness 3, shadowBrightness 2, timerInterval 0.1s, animationDuration 0.3s, color `.accentColor`. Trail effect from animation overlap.
   - **VaultTheme view modifiers**: `.vaultBackgroundStyle()`, `.vaultGlassBackground()`, `.vaultGlassTintedBackground(tint:)`, `.vaultProminentButtonStyle()`, `.vaultSecondaryButtonStyle()`
   - **Observable pattern**: `AppState` uses `@Observable` (iOS 17+), not `ObservableObject`
   - **Build command**: `xcodebuild -project Vault.xcodeproj -scheme Vault -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,id=57965726-931A-462A-A262-3A3DAFA7CDDF' -configuration Debug build`

3. Files and Code Sections:

   - **`apps/ios/Vault/App/VaultApp.swift`**
     - Central to appearance mode management. Contains `AppAppearanceMode` enum and `AppState` class.
     - Added `applyAppearanceToAllWindows()` method and `.onAppear` call to apply on launch.
     - Added `.preferredColorScheme()` was already on WindowGroup (line 40).
     ```swift
     func applyAppearanceToAllWindows() {
         let style: UIUserInterfaceStyle = switch appearanceMode {
         case .system: .unspecified
         case .light: .light
         case .dark: .dark
         }
         for scene in UIApplication.shared.connectedScenes {
             guard let windowScene = scene as? UIWindowScene else { continue }
             for window in windowScene.windows {
                 window.overrideUserInterfaceStyle = style
             }
         }
     }
     ```

   - **`apps/ios/Vault/Features/Settings/SettingsView.swift`**
     - Contains `AppSettingsView`, `AppearanceSettingsView` (new), `DuressPatternSettingsView`, `iCloudBackupSettingsView`, `RestoreFromBackupView`
     - Replaced segmented Picker with NavigationLink to new `AppearanceSettingsView`
     - Created `AppearanceSettingsView` with checkmark list:
     ```swift
     struct AppearanceSettingsView: View {
         @Environment(AppState.self) private var appState
         var body: some View {
             List {
                 Section {
                     ForEach(AppAppearanceMode.allCases, id: \.rawValue) { mode in
                         Button {
                             appState.setAppearanceMode(mode)
                         } label: {
                             HStack {
                                 Text(mode.title)
                                     .foregroundStyle(.primary)
                                 Spacer()
                                 if appState.appearanceMode == mode {
                                     Image(systemName: "checkmark")
                                         .foregroundStyle(.accent)
                                         .fontWeight(.semibold)
                                 }
                             }
                         }
                         .accessibilityIdentifier("appearance_\(mode.rawValue)")
                     }
                 }
             }
             .navigationTitle("Appearance")
             .navigationBarTitleDisplayMode(.inline)
         }
     }
     ```
     - Duress setup sheet at line 515 and restore from backup sheet at line 629 need converting to fullScreenCover (pending).

   - **`apps/ios/Vault/Features/VaultViewer/VaultView.swift`**
     - Settings sheet (line 396) had `.preferredColorScheme()` added. Needs converting to `.fullScreenCover()`.
     - File viewer sheet (line 382) with `.presentationDetents([.medium, .large])` needs converting.
     - Camera (line 350) and photo picker (line 353) sheets to KEEP.
     - Photo viewer fallback at line 379 still has `Color.black.ignoresSafeArea()` (should be fixed).

   - **`apps/ios/Vault/Features/VaultViewer/SecureImageViewer.swift`**
     - Replaced `Color.black` backgrounds with `Color.vaultBackground`
     - Removed `.foregroundStyle(.white)` from toolbar buttons
     - Error view text changed from `.white`/`.gray` to default/`.vaultSecondaryText`

   - **`apps/ios/Vault/Features/VaultViewer/SecureVideoPlayer.swift`**
     - Same treatment as SecureImageViewer

   - **`apps/ios/Vault/Features/VaultViewer/FullScreenPhotoViewer.swift`**
     - `Color.black` → `Color.vaultBackground` for backgrounds
     - Removed `.foregroundStyle(.white)` from toolbar buttons
     - Play button icon: `.foregroundStyle(.white.opacity(0.9))` → `.foregroundStyle(.vaultSecondaryText)`
     - Removed `.tint(.white)` from ProgressView

   - **`apps/ios/Vault/Core/Billing/PaywallTrigger.swift`**
     - Removed `.preferredColorScheme(.dark)` override
     - `Color.black` → `Color.vaultBackground`
     - Removed `.foregroundStyle(.white)` from title and feature list text

   - **`apps/ios/Vault/UI/Components/ToastView.swift`**
     - Removed `.foregroundStyle(.white)` from icon and text
     - Removed `.background(Color.black.opacity(0.6))` — kept `.ultraThinMaterial` only
     - Removed explicit shadow color

   - **`apps/ios/Vault/App/ContentView.swift`**
     - Screenshot overlay: `Color.black` → `Color.vaultBackground`

   - **`apps/ios/Vault/UI/Components/PixelAnimation.swift`**
     - Fixed default `animationDuration` from `0.25` to `0.3` in both property declaration and init parameter
     - Preview backgrounds: `.background(.black)` → `.background(Color.vaultBackground)`

   - **`apps/ios/DESIGN.md`** (new file)
     - Brand guidelines covering color palette, typography, pixel loader spec, view modifiers, appearance mode rules, layout patterns, error/success states, accessibility

   - **`apps/ios/Vault/Features/PatternLock/PatternLockView.swift`**
     - Read but NOT modified. RecoveryPhraseInputView (line 228+) was found to be already properly themed with `.vaultSurface`, `.vaultBackground`, `.vaultSecondaryText`. The "all black" issue was from missing color scheme propagation on `.fullScreenCover`, not hardcoded colors.
     - Has NavigationStack with Cancel button ✅

   - **`apps/ios/Vault/Features/Settings/VaultSettingsView.swift`**
     - Read for sheet presentations at lines 158, 162, 165, 168. These need converting to `.fullScreenCover()` (pending).
     - Already has NavigationStack with Done toolbar button ✅

   - **`apps/ios/Vault/Features/Settings/RecoveryPhraseView.swift`**
     - Read for pending conversion. Has NavigationStack ✅

   - **`apps/ios/Vault/Features/Sharing/ShareVaultView.swift`**
     - Read first 50 lines. Has its own header bar with Cancel button ✅

   - **`apps/ios/Vault/Features/Camera/SecureCameraView.swift`**
     - Read but intentionally NOT modified. Camera needs black background for preview (standard iOS pattern). White controls are intentional for overlay on variable camera content.

   - **`apps/ios/Vault/UI/Theme/VaultTheme.swift`**
     - Read for reference. Contains all view modifier definitions including glass effects for iOS 26+.

   - **Color asset values** (from exploration):
     | Token | Light | Dark |
     |-------|-------|------|
     | VaultBackground | #D1D1E9 | #20233C |
     | VaultSurface | #FFFFFE | #323444 |
     | VaultText | #2B2C34 | #E8E8F0 |
     | VaultSecondaryText | #2B2C34 @ 70% | #E8E8F0 @ 78% |
     | VaultHighlight | #E45858 | #FF6F6F |
     | AccentColor | #6246EA | #6E5CFA |

4. Errors and Fixes:
   - **Simulator name ambiguity**: `xcodebuild` failed with "multiple devices matched" for `iPhone 17 Pro` (two simulators with different casing). Fixed by using explicit simulator UUID: `id=57965726-931A-462A-A262-3A3DAFA7CDDF`.
   - **SourceKit false positives**: Many "Cannot find X in scope" diagnostics appeared throughout the session. These are documented in the scratch pad as known false positives — cross-file SourceKit diagnostics don't represent real build errors. Ignored them and verified with actual `xcodebuild`.
   - No user feedback corrections on errors — user approved the approaches taken.

5. Problem Solving:
   - **Root cause of "all black" screens**: `.fullScreenCover()` and `.sheet()` are separate presentation contexts that don't inherit `.preferredColorScheme()` from parent. Solved with global `UIWindow.overrideUserInterfaceStyle` in `AppState.applyAppearanceToAllWindows()`.
   - **Pixel loader inconsistency**: Found all 10 in-app usages correctly use factory methods. Only the struct's default parameters had wrong `animationDuration` (0.25 vs canonical 0.3). Fixed the latent bug.
   - **Design audit**: Identified intentional vs accidental hardcoded colors. Kept intentional ones (camera, thumbnail overlays, accent button text) and fixed all others.

6. All User Messages:
   - "I want to clean up and unify all design across the app. First, the mode of the app, system, dark, light doesn't immediately change the design of the screen. Instead it changes the back screen but not the settings screen. Second I think this should be a menu Settings -> App settings -> Appearance -> System, Dark, Light. And it should change the whole screen instantly. Also don't push to testflight just yet. I got lots of things I want to fix"
   - "The 'use recovery phrase' screen is all black. The join shared vault screen has all black text area. Set custom recovery phrase screen is completely different. Go through all screens and unify the colors. I want everything to use the structure of the set custom recovery phrase. When you are done, I want you write up brand guidelines, fonts, colors, etc, and adhere to them everywhere. Also the pixel loader is different in every screen.

   - "Ok, now because we don't use anymore the half cards in join vault and recover with passphrase, I guess we shouldn't use it elsewhere. So maybe we should switch to full screen all screens, including all settings. That means we need buttons at the top. But before we do so, I would like your take on this"
   - "Ok I agree, let's keep the system sheets what you suggested and change the rest"

7. Pending Tasks:
   - **Convert `.sheet()` to `.fullScreenCover()` for all non-system presentations**:
     - `VaultView.swift` line 396: Settings sheet → fullScreenCover (remove `.presentationDetents`, remove `.preferredColorScheme`)
     - `VaultView.swift` line 382: File viewer sheet → fullScreenCover (remove `.presentationDetents([.medium, .large])`)
     - `VaultSettingsView.swift` line 158: Change pattern sheet → fullScreenCover
     - `VaultSettingsView.swift` line 162: Recovery phrase sheet → fullScreenCover
     - `VaultSettingsView.swift` line 165: Share vault sheet → fullScreenCover
     - `VaultSettingsView.swift` line 168: Custom phrase sheet → fullScreenCover
     - `SettingsView.swift` line 515: Duress setup sheet → fullScreenCover
     - `SettingsView.swift` line 629: Restore from backup sheet → fullScreenCover
     - `PaywallTrigger.swift` line 29: Paywall sheet → fullScreenCover
   - KEEP as sheets: Camera (VaultView line 350), Photo picker (VaultView line 353)
   - Fix stale `Color.black.ignoresSafeArea()` at VaultView.swift line 379
   - Ensure all presented views have proper NavigationStack with Done/Cancel buttons
   - Session close protocol: git add, bd sync, git commit, git push
   - Update `.scratch-pad.md` with session learnings

8. Current Work:
   I was about to start converting `.sheet()` presentations to `.fullScreenCover()` throughout the app. I had just finished reading the files that needed modification to verify they have proper NavigationStack with toolbar buttons:
   - `RecoveryPhraseView.swift` — has NavigationStack ✅
   - `ShareVaultView.swift` — has its own header with Cancel button ✅
   - `VaultView.swift` lines 345-405 — identified which sheets to convert vs keep

   The user confirmed: "Ok I agree, let's keep the system sheets what you suggested and change the rest"

9. Optional Next Step:
   Begin the `.sheet()` → `.fullScreenCover()` conversion across all identified files. The user said: "Ok I agree, let's keep the system sheets what you suggested and change the rest." 
   
   Specifically, start with `VaultView.swift` converting:
   - Line 396: Settings `.sheet` → `.fullScreenCover` (remove `.presentationDetents([.large])` and `.preferredColorScheme(...)`)
   - Line 382: File viewer `.sheet(item:)` → `.fullScreenCover(item:)` (remove `.presentationDetents([.medium, .large])`)
   
   Then move to `VaultSettingsView.swift` (lines 158, 162, 165, 168) and `SettingsView.swift` (lines 515, 629) and `PaywallTrigger.swift` (line 29).
   
   Each needs verification that the presented view has a NavigationStack with proper Done/Cancel toolbar buttons. Build and commit after all changes.

If you need specific details from before compaction (like exact code snippets, error messages, or content you generated), read the full transcript at: /Users/nan/.REDACTED.jsonl
Please continue the conversation from where we left off without asking the user any further questions. Continue with the last task that you were asked to work on.

---

When using the share extension adding lots of files, the files don't get really synced. If you watch the video /Users/nan/Downloads/ScreenRecording_02-14-2026\ 21-33-19_1.MP4 you can see that it never gets past 40% and when I open the vault nothing shows in it. In fact on the first attempt the app crashesh and then data never shows up there

---

Ok push everything into testflight

Base directory for this skill: /Users/nan/.claude/skills/asc-release-flow

# Release flow (TestFlight and App Store)

Use this skill when you need to get a new build into TestFlight or submit to the App Store.

## Preconditions
- Ensure credentials are set (`asc auth login` or `ASC_*` env vars).
- Use a new build number for each upload.
- Prefer `ASC_APP_ID` or pass `--app` explicitly.
- Build must have encryption compliance resolved (see asc-submission-health skill).

## iOS Release

### Preferred end-to-end commands
- TestFlight:
  - `asc publish testflight --app <APP_ID> --ipa <PATH> --group <GROUP_ID>[,<GROUP_ID>]`
  - Optional: `--wait`, `--notify`, `--platform`, `--poll-interval`, `--timeout`
- App Store:
  - `asc publish appstore --app <APP_ID> --ipa <PATH> --version <VERSION>`
  - Optional: `--wait`, `--submit --confirm`, `--platform`, `--poll-interval`, `--timeout`

### Manual sequence (when you need more control)
1. Upload the build:
   - `asc builds upload --app <APP_ID> --ipa <PATH>`
2. Find the build ID if needed:
   - `asc builds latest --app <APP_ID> [--version <VERSION>] [--platform <PLATFORM>]`
3. TestFlight distribution:
   - `asc builds add-groups --build <BUILD_ID> --group <GROUP_ID>[,<GROUP_ID>]`
4. App Store attach + submit:
   - `asc versions attach-build --version-id <VERSION_ID> --build <BUILD_ID>`
   - `asc submit create --app <APP_ID> --version <VERSION> --build <BUILD_ID> --confirm`
5. Check or cancel submission:
   - `asc submit status --id <SUBMISSION_ID>` or `--version-id <VERSION_ID>`
   - `asc submit cancel --id <SUBMISSION_ID> --confirm`

## macOS Release

macOS apps are distributed as `.pkg` files, not `.ipa`.

### Build and Export
See `asc-xcode-build` skill for full build/archive/export workflow.

### Upload PKG
Use `xcrun altool` (asc doesn't yet support .pkg uploads directly):
```bash
# Ensure API key is in ~/.appstoreconnect/private_keys/
xcrun altool --upload-app \
  -f "/path/to/YourApp.pkg" \
  --type macos \
  --apiKey "$ASC_KEY_ID" \
  --apiIssuer "$ASC_ISSUER_ID"
```

### Attach and Submit
Same as iOS, but use `--platform MAC_OS`:
```bash
# Wait for build to process
asc builds list --app <APP_ID> --platform MAC_OS --limit 5

# Attach to version
asc versions attach-build --version-id <VERSION_ID> --build <BUILD_ID>

# Create submission
asc review submissions-create --app <APP_ID> --platform MAC_OS

# Add version item
asc review items-add \
  --submission <SUBMISSION_ID> \
  --item-type appStoreVersions \
  --item-id <VERSION_ID>

# Submit
asc review submissions-submit --id <SUBMISSION_ID> --confirm
```

## visionOS / tvOS Release

Same as iOS flow, use appropriate `--platform`:
- `VISION_OS`
- `TV_OS`

## Multi-Platform Release

When releasing the same version across platforms:
1. Upload each platform's build separately
2. Create version for each platform if not exists
3. Attach builds to respective versions
4. Submit each platform separately (or together via reviewSubmissions API)

## Pre-submission Checklist
Before submitting, verify:
- [ ] Build status is `VALID` (not processing)
- [ ] Encryption compliance resolved
- [ ] Content rights declaration set
- [ ] Copyright field populated
- [ ] All localizations complete
- [ ] Screenshots present

See `asc-submission-health` skill for detailed preflight checks.

## Notes
- Always use `--help` to verify flags for the exact command.
- Use `--output table` / `--output markdown` for human-readable output; default is JSON.
- macOS builds require `ITSAppUsesNonExemptEncryption` in Info.plist to avoid encryption issues.

Here is bunch of screens. As you can see they all have different background. I want all use the same structure. Like the paywall looks so weird now becuase you removed the background. I don't like the black background. I want you to return it back to image 8 but no black text area. Put the same background

This session is being continued from a previous conversation that ran out of context. The summary below covers the earlier portion of the conversation.

Analysis:
Let me chronologically analyze the entire conversation:

**Session Start Context**: This session is a continuation from a previous conversation that ran out of context. The previous session covered:
- Appearance mode fix (system/dark/light) with UIWindow.overrideUserInterfaceStyle
- Color unification across the app (replacing hardcoded colors with VaultTheme tokens)
- PixelAnimation timing fix
- Creating DESIGN.md brand guidelines
- Starting sheet → fullScreenCover conversion

**Message 1 (Assistant - Continuation)**: Picked up where the previous session left off, reading all files that needed sheet → fullScreenCover conversion.

**Changes Made - Sheet to FullScreenCover**:
1. VaultView.swift: Fixed `Color.black` → `Color.vaultBackground` at line 379, converted file viewer `.sheet` → `.fullScreenCover` (removed `.presentationDetents`), converted settings `.sheet` → `.fullScreenCover` (removed `.presentationDetents` and `.preferredColorScheme`)
2. VaultSettingsView.swift: Converted all 4 sheets (ChangePattern, RecoveryPhrase, ShareVault, CustomPhrase) to `.fullScreenCover`
3. SettingsView.swift: Converted duress setup and restore from backup sheets to `.fullScreenCover`
4. PaywallTrigger.swift: Converted paywall sheet to `.fullScreenCover`
5. VaultairePaywallView.swift: Wrapped body in NavigationStack with X dismiss button (since it had no dismiss mechanism for fullScreenCover)
6. ShareVaultView.swift: Replaced custom VStack header with NavigationStack + toolbar Cancel button

Build succeeded, committed as "Switch modal presentations from sheets to full-screen covers", pushed to remote.

**Message 2 (User)**: "When using the share extension adding lots of files, the files don't get really synced. If you watch the video... you can see that it never gets past 40% and when I open the vault nothing shows in it. In fact on the first attempt the app crashes and then data never shows up there"

**Investigation of Share Extension Bug**:
- Explored share extension code structure via agent
- Read ShareViewController.swift (404 lines) - the main extension controller
- Read ImportIngestor.swift - processes staged imports into vault storage
- Read StagedImportManager.swift - manages pending_imports directory
- Read CryptoEngine.swift - found encryptStreaming() and encryptFileStreamingToHandle()

**Root Cause Identified**:
1. `encryptStreaming()` accumulates entire encrypted output in a `Data` buffer in memory. For large files (videos 50MB+), this exceeds the ~120MB share extension memory limit.
2. Temp files from `loadFile()` are never cleaned up between iterations
3. Temp filenames can collide (same `url.lastPathComponent`)
4. Extension gets killed by iOS before writing manifest.json (written last as atomic visibility marker), so main app never sees the batch

**Fixes Applied**:
1. ShareViewController.swift `processAttachment()`: 
   - Added `defer { try? FileManager.default.removeItem(at: tempURL) }` for temp cleanup
   - Replaced `encryptStreaming()` (in-memory) with `encryptFileStreamingToHandle()` (writes directly to file, ~256KB peak memory)
   - Used UUID-prefixed temp filenames to prevent collisions
2. ImportIngestor.swift `processBatch()`:
   - Writes decrypted data to temp file, then uses `storeFileFromURL()` instead of `storeFile(data:)` to avoid holding both decrypted and re-encrypted data in memory simultaneously

Build succeeded, committed as "Fix share extension crash when importing many/large files", pushed.

**Message 3 (User)**: "Ok push everything into testflight"

**TestFlight Upload**:
- Bumped build from 35 to 36
- Archived with xcodebuild
- Export failed with "Failed to Use Accounts" - known issue from previous sessions
- Used local export plist (without destination:upload), then uploaded via `asc builds upload --app 6758529311 --ipa /tmp/VaultExport/Vault.ipa`
- Upload succeeded with ID 3a302771-a90d-4302-95c5-2d530b7ef29f
- Committed build bump, pushed to remote

**Message 4 (User)**: Provided 8 screenshots showing inconsistent backgrounds. Key issues:
- Paywall: dark navy background (vaultBackground) - user says it "looks weird now"
- Welcome: BLACK background 
- Change Pattern: BLACK background
- Custom Recovery Phrase: BLACK background
- Pattern Lock: dark navy (correct)
- Recovery phrase input: BLACK background, TextEditor area is BLACK
- Join Shared Vault: dark navy background (correct), but TextEditor area is BLACK

User says: "I want all use the same structure. Like the paywall looks so weird now because you removed the background. I don't like the black background. I want you to return it back to image 8 but no black text area. Put the same background"

**Fixes Applied (in progress)**:

Added `Color.vaultBackground.ignoresSafeArea()` background to:
1. WelcomeView.swift
2. ChangePatternView (VaultSettingsView.swift)
3. RecoveryPhraseView.swift
4. CustomRecoveryPhraseInputView (VaultSettingsView.swift)

Added `.scrollContentBackground(.hidden)` to TextEditors (so `Color.vaultSurface` background shows through instead of system black):
1. JoinVaultView.swift (line 93)
2. PatternLockView.swift RecoveryPhraseInputView (line 247)
3. VaultSettingsView.swift CustomRecoveryPhraseInputView (line 1002)
4. PatternSetupView.swift (line 164)

**Current state**: Was in the middle of checking if PatternSetupView.swift also needs a vaultBackground. Found it has no vaultBackground set. Had just read the beginning of the file and was about to add background to it. Have NOT yet built or committed these changes.

Summary:
1. Primary Request and Intent:
   The user has been progressively requesting design unification across the Vaultaire iOS app across multiple rounds:
   
   **Round 1 (previous session, carried forward)**: Fix appearance mode (system/dark/light) to instantly update all screens including sheets/modals. Move setting to Settings → App Settings → Appearance. Replace hardcoded colors with VaultTheme tokens. Unify pixel loaders to match Dynamic Island spec. Write brand design guidelines.
   
   **Round 2 (this session start)**: Convert all non-system modal presentations from `.sheet()` to `.fullScreenCover()`. Keep system sheets (camera, photo picker) as-is. User approved this approach: "Ok I agree, let's keep the system sheets what you suggested and change the rest"
   
   **Round 3**: Fix share extension crash when importing many/large files. Progress stalls at 40%, app crashes, data never appears.
   
   **Round 4**: Push to TestFlight (build 36).
   
   **Round 5 (current, in progress)**: User provided 8 screenshots showing inconsistent backgrounds. Many screens show pure BLACK backgrounds instead of the dark navy `vaultBackground` (`#20233C`). TextEditor fields show BLACK instead of `vaultSurface`. User explicitly said: "I want all use the same structure. Like the paywall looks so weird now because you removed the background. I don't like the black background. I want you to return it back to image 8 but no black text area. Put the same background." The user wants ALL screens to use `Color.vaultBackground` and all TextEditors to show `vaultSurface` instead of system black.

2. Key Technical Concepts:
   - **SwiftUI `.fullScreenCover()` default background**: Views presented via `.fullScreenCover()` default to system black in dark mode unless an explicit background is set
   - **SwiftUI TextEditor default background**: `TextEditor` has its own opaque background that covers `.background()` modifiers. Must use `.scrollContentBackground(.hidden)` to remove the default background so `.background(Color.vaultSurface)` shows through
   - **UIWindow.overrideUserInterfaceStyle**: Applied globally to all windows to propagate appearance mode to sheets, fullScreenCovers, and alerts
   - **Share extension memory limit**: ~120MB. `encryptStreaming()` accumulated entire encrypted output in RAM. `encryptFileStreamingToHandle()` writes chunk-by-chunk with ~256KB peak memory
   - **Atomic manifest pattern**: Share extension writes `manifest.json` LAST so main app only sees complete batches
   - **VaultTheme color tokens**: `vaultBackground` (#D1D1E9 light / #20233C dark navy), `vaultSurface` (#FFFFFE / #323444 slate), `vaultText`, `vaultSecondaryText`, `vaultHighlight`, `AccentColor`
   - **TestFlight upload flow**: Archive → local export (ExportOptionsLocal.plist without destination:upload) → upload via `asc builds upload --app 6758529311 --ipa <path>`
   - **Build command**: `xcodebuild -project Vault.xcodeproj -scheme Vault -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,id=57965726-931A-462A-A262-3A3DAFA7CDDF' -configuration Debug build`
   - **SourceKit false positives**: Cross-file diagnostics like "Cannot find 'AppState' in scope" are not real build errors

             .background(Color.vaultBackground.ignoresSafeArea())
             .toolbar {
                 ToolbarItem(placement: .cancellationAction) {
                     Button {
                         onDismiss()
                     } label: {

                             .foregroundStyle(.vaultSecondaryText)
                     }
                 }
             }
         }
     }
     ```

   - **`apps/ios/Vault/Features/Sharing/ShareVaultView.swift`**
     - Replaced custom VStack header with NavigationStack + toolbar
     - Already had `.interactiveDismissDisabled()` for upload protection
     ```swift
     var body: some View {
         NavigationStack {
             ScrollView { ... }
             .navigationTitle("Share Vault")
             .navigationBarTitleDisplayMode(.inline)
             .toolbar {
                 ToolbarItem(placement: .cancellationAction) {
                     Button("Cancel") {
                         if case .uploading = mode {
                             showDismissWarning = true
                         } else {
                             dismiss()
                         }
                     }
                     .accessibilityIdentifier("share_cancel")
                 }
             }
         }
     ```

   - **`apps/ios/Vault/Features/Sharing/JoinVaultView.swift`**
     - Already had `Color.vaultBackground.ignoresSafeArea()` but TextEditor showed black
     - **Added `.scrollContentBackground(.hidden)`** to TextEditor
     ```swift
     TextEditor(text: $phrase)
         .scrollContentBackground(.hidden)
         .frame(height: 100)
         .padding(8)
         .background(Color.vaultSurface)
     ```

   - **`apps/ios/Vault/Features/PatternLock/PatternLockView.swift`**
     - Contains RecoveryPhraseInputView (used from lock screen "Use recovery phrase")
     - Already had `.background(Color.vaultBackground.ignoresSafeArea())` on outer view
     - **Added `.scrollContentBackground(.hidden)`** to TextEditor
     ```swift
     TextEditor(text: $phrase)
         .scrollContentBackground(.hidden)
         .frame(height: 120)
         .padding(8)
         .background(Color.vaultSurface)
     ```

     }
     .background(Color.vaultBackground.ignoresSafeArea())
     ```

   - **`apps/ios/Vault/Features/Onboarding/PatternSetupView.swift`**
     - Pattern setup during onboarding with custom phrase TextEditor
     - **Added `.scrollContentBackground(.hidden)`** to TextEditor
     - **Missing `vaultBackground`** — identified but NOT yet fixed
     ```swift
     TextEditor(text: $customPhrase)
         .scrollContentBackground(.hidden)
         .autocorrectionDisabled()
     ```

   - **`apps/ios/Vault/Extensions/ShareExtension/ShareViewController.swift`**
     - Fixed memory crash by using stream-to-file encryption
     - Added temp file cleanup and UUID-prefixed temp filenames
     ```swift
     // Stream-encrypt directly to output file — peak memory ~256KB
     let encryptedURL = batchURL.appendingPathComponent("\(fileId.uuidString).enc")
     FileManager.default.createFile(atPath: encryptedURL.path, contents: nil)
     let outputHandle = try FileHandle(forWritingTo: encryptedURL)
     defer { try? outputHandle.close() }
     try CryptoEngine.encryptFileStreamingToHandle(from: tempURL, to: outputHandle, with: key)
     
     // Temp file cleanup
     defer { try? FileManager.default.removeItem(at: tempURL) }
     
     // UUID-prefixed temp filenames
     let tempURL = tempDir.appendingPathComponent("\(UUID().uuidString)_\(url.lastPathComponent)")
     ```

   - **`apps/ios/Vault/Core/Storage/ImportIngestor.swift`**
     - Fixed to write decrypted data to temp file then use `storeFileFromURL()`
     ```swift
     let tempURL = FileManager.default.temporaryDirectory
         .appendingPathComponent("\(file.fileId.uuidString)_import")
         .appendingPathExtension(URL(string: file.filename)?.pathExtension ?? "dat")
     try decryptedData.write(to: tempURL)
     _ = try VaultStorage.shared.storeFileFromURL(
         tempURL, filename: file.filename, mimeType: file.mimeType,
         with: vaultKey, thumbnailData: thumbnailData
     )
     try? FileManager.default.removeItem(at: tempURL)
     ```

   - **`apps/ios/Vault.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj`**
     - Build number bumped from 35 to 36

4. Errors and Fixes:
   - **Export archive "Failed to Use Accounts"**: Known issue from previous sessions. Fixed by using local export plist (without `destination: upload`) then uploading separately via `asc` CLI tool.
   - **Export "requires a provisioning profile"**: Fixed by adding `signingStyle: automatic` to export plist and using `-allowProvisioningUpdates` flag.
   - **SourceKit false positive diagnostics**: "Cannot find 'AppState' in scope", "Type 'Color' has no member 'vaultBackground'" etc. These are cross-file SourceKit resolution issues, not real build errors. Verified by running actual xcodebuild which succeeds.
   - **Share extension crash at ~40%**: Root cause was `encryptStreaming()` accumulating entire encrypted output in RAM, exceeding ~120MB extension memory limit. Fixed by using `encryptFileStreamingToHandle()` which writes chunk-by-chunk with ~256KB peak memory.
   - **Black backgrounds on fullScreenCover views**: Views presented via `.fullScreenCover()` default to system black in dark mode. Fixed by adding explicit `Color.vaultBackground.ignoresSafeArea()` to each view.
   - **Black TextEditor backgrounds**: SwiftUI TextEditor has its own opaque background that covers `.background()` modifiers. Fixed by adding `.scrollContentBackground(.hidden)` before `.background(Color.vaultSurface)`.

5. Problem Solving:
   - **Sheet → FullScreenCover conversion**: Successfully converted all non-system sheets. Had to identify which views already had NavigationStack + toolbar buttons (most did) vs which needed wrapping (VaultairePaywallView, ShareVaultView).
   - **Share extension memory crash**: Traced through the full data flow from share extension → app group container → main app import. Identified that `encryptStreaming()` builds entire output in memory while `encryptFileStreamingToHandle()` streams to disk. Also fixed ImportIngestor to use `storeFileFromURL()` to reduce memory during re-encryption.
   - **Background color inconsistency (in progress)**: Systematically identified all screens showing black vs dark navy by cross-referencing screenshots with code. Found two categories: views missing explicit background, and TextEditors with opaque default backgrounds.

6. All User Messages:
   - (Context from previous session carried forward - user approved sheet → fullScreenCover strategy): "Ok I agree, let's keep the system sheets what you suggested and change the rest"
   - "When using the share extension adding lots of files, the files don't get really synced. If you watch the video /Users/nan/Downloads/ScreenRecording_02-14-2026\ 21-33-19_1.MP4 you can see that it never gets past 40% and when I open the vault nothing shows in it. In fact on the first attempt the app crashesh and then data never shows up there"
   - "Ok push everything into testflight"
   - "Here is bunch of screens. As you can see they all have different background. I want all use the same structure. Like the paywall looks so weird now becuase you removed the background. I don't like the black background. I want you to return it back to image 8 but no black text area. Put the same background" (with 8 screenshots showing inconsistent backgrounds)

7. Pending Tasks:
   - **Complete background unification (in progress)**: PatternSetupView.swift still needs `Color.vaultBackground.ignoresSafeArea()` added
   - **Build and verify** all background/TextEditor changes compile cleanly
   - **Commit and push** the background unification changes
   - **Session close protocol**: git add, bd sync, git commit, git push, update scratch-pad
   - User said "don't push to testflight" in the original session but then later asked to push to TestFlight. The most recent request is purely about fixing backgrounds — no TestFlight push requested yet for these changes.

8. Current Work:
   Actively fixing black backgrounds across the app per user's screenshot feedback. Have completed:
   - Added `Color.vaultBackground.ignoresSafeArea()` to: WelcomeView, ChangePatternView, RecoveryPhraseView, CustomRecoveryPhraseInputView
   - Added `.scrollContentBackground(.hidden)` to all 4 TextEditors: JoinVaultView, RecoveryPhraseInputView, CustomRecoveryPhraseInputView, PatternSetupView
   
   Was in the middle of checking PatternSetupView.swift for missing background. Confirmed it has NO `vaultBackground` set (only has `.background(Color.vaultSurface)` on the TextEditor). Had just read the beginning of the file (lines 1-40) to understand its structure before adding the background.

9. Optional Next Step:
   Add `Color.vaultBackground.ignoresSafeArea()` to PatternSetupView.swift, then build to verify all changes compile, then commit and push. The user's request was: "I want all use the same structure... Put the same background" — PatternSetupView is the last identified view missing the background.

The appearance functionality is not working well. Watch the video /Users/nan/Downloads/ScreenRecording_02-14-2026\ 22-15-50_1.MP4

When I change it nothing happens until I fully exit to the vault view. This should apply immediately

The share extension is still crashing at large amount of files or large files. Either way the experience is not good. We need to figure out a way to make it work.

---

I want you to review one more time this code so we don't deploy it to crash again

---

Ok. One more time. Review all the extension's code and make sure large and large amount of files can be processed properly

This session is being continued from a previous conversation that ran out of context. The summary below covers the earlier portion of the conversation.

Analysis:
Let me chronologically analyze the conversation:

**Context from previous session (carried forward):**
- Previous session covered: appearance mode fix, color unification, sheet→fullScreenCover conversion, share extension memory crash fix, TestFlight build 36 upload, and started fixing black backgrounds across screens.

**Message 1 (Continuation start):**
- The session picked up adding `Color.vaultBackground.ignoresSafeArea()` to PatternSetupView.swift
- Built successfully, committed "Add consistent vaultBackground and fix TextEditor backgrounds", pushed

**Message 2 (User):**
"The appearance functionality is not working well. Watch the video... When I change it nothing happens until I fully exit to the vault view. This should apply immediately"

**Investigation and Fix:**
- Extracted frames from video showing: user selects Dark in Appearance settings, but the screen stays light until navigating back
- Root cause: `overrideUserInterfaceStyle` on UIKit windows doesn't force immediate SwiftUI re-render of currently visible views
- Fix: Added `.preferredColorScheme(appState.appearanceMode.preferredColorScheme)` directly on the settings fullScreenCover content in VaultView.swift
- Committed "Fix appearance mode not updating immediately in settings", pushed

**Message 3 (User):**
"The share extension is still crashing at large amount of files or large files. Either way the experience is not good. We need to figure out a way to make it work."

**Investigation and Fix:**
- Read ShareViewController.swift, CryptoEngine.swift, VaultCoreConstants.swift thoroughly
- Identified root cause: `generateThumbnail` used `UIImage(contentsOfFile:)` which loads entire bitmap into memory (~48MB per 12MP photo)
- Fix 1: Replaced UIImage thumbnail with CGImageSource (ImageIO) - ~200KB peak instead of ~48MB
- Fix 2: Wrapped synchronous work in autoreleasepool inside processAttachment
- Fix 3: Released receivedItems after processing loop
- Committed "Fix share extension memory crashes with CGImageSource thumbnails", pushed

**Message 4 (User):**
"I want you to review one more time this code so we don't deploy it to crash again"

**Thorough Review:**
- Re-read entire ShareViewController.swift
- Re-read encryptFileStreamingToHandle in CryptoEngine.swift
- Analyzed memory profile for 50 photos and large videos
- Found two additional issues:
  1. Double-invocation race in patternComplete (no guard against multiple calls)
  2. KeyDerivation.deriveKey error silently swallowed in Task
- Fixed both: added isProcessing guard, added error handling for key derivation failure
- Released receivedItems after processing
- Committed "Harden share extension against double-invocation and memory leaks", pushed

**Message 5 (User):**
"Ok. One more time. Review all the extension's code and make sure large and large amount of files can be processed properly"

**Comprehensive Review of ALL Extension Code:**
- Read PatternInputView.swift (UIKit pattern grid) - no issues
- Read Info.plist - allows 100 images, 10 videos, 100 files
- Re-read ShareViewController.swift completely
- Read KeyDerivation.swift - PBKDF2 with 600K iterations, ~1KB memory
- Read VaultCoreConstants.swift - streaming threshold 1MB, chunk size 256KB
- Read StagedImportManager.swift - batch directory management
- Read CryptoEngine.swift streaming encryption paths

**Critical Finding:**
- `FileHandle.write(_ data: Data)` is the legacy non-throwing method used throughout `encryptFileStreamingToHandle`
- On disk-full, this throws an Objective-C NSException that Swift catch blocks can't catch → extension crashes
- Fixed by replacing all `handle.write(data)` calls with `try handle.write(contentsOf: data)` in `encryptFileStreamingToHandle`

**Remaining non-throwing handle.write:**
- Line 335 in `decryptStreamingToFile`: `handle.write(decrypted)` — this is in a decryption method, not used by share extension, but still has the same issue. However, the user asked specifically about the share extension path.

**Current state:**
- The `encryptFileStreamingToHandle` method has been updated with throwing write calls
- SourceKit diagnostics shown are false positives (cross-file resolution issues)
- There's one remaining `handle.write(decrypted)` at line 335 in `decryptStreamingToFile` that still uses the non-throwing version
- The build has NOT been run yet after the CryptoEngine changes
- The changes have NOT been committed or pushed yet

Let me also note the other handle.write calls in decryption methods (lines 335, 380) that were NOT changed but also use the non-throwing version. These are in decryption paths used by the main app, not the share extension.

Summary:
1. Primary Request and Intent:

   This session continued from a previous conversation covering design unification across the Vaultaire iOS app. The user had multiple sequential requests:

   **Request 1 (carried from previous session):** Fix inconsistent black backgrounds across screens. Add `Color.vaultBackground.ignoresSafeArea()` to all fullScreenCover-presented views and `.scrollContentBackground(.hidden)` to all TextEditors so themed colors show through.

   **Request 2:** Fix appearance mode (system/dark/light) not updating immediately when changed in Settings → App Settings → Appearance. The user showed a video where selecting "Dark" didn't change the current screen until navigating away and back.

   **Request 3:** Fix the share extension crashing when importing large files or many files. The experience was "not good" and files never appeared in the vault.

   **Request 4:** Review the share extension code again before deploying to ensure it won't crash.

   **Request 5 (most recent):** Review ALL the extension's code one more time to make sure large and large amounts of files can be processed properly.

2. Key Technical Concepts:
   - **SwiftUI `.preferredColorScheme()` vs UIKit `overrideUserInterfaceStyle`**: UIKit window style override doesn't trigger immediate SwiftUI re-renders of already-visible views. Need `.preferredColorScheme()` on fullScreenCover content for reactive updates.
   - **iOS Share Extension ~120MB memory limit**: Extensions get killed by iOS when exceeding memory budget.
   - **CGImageSource vs UIImage for thumbnails**: `UIImage(contentsOfFile:)` loads full bitmap (~48MB for 12MP photo). `CGImageSourceCreateThumbnailAtIndex` generates downsampled thumbnail without full decode (~200KB).
   - **`autoreleasepool` in Swift**: Cannot wrap `async` closures directly. Must wrap synchronous work blocks. Drains Objective-C temporaries between iterations.
   - **`FileHandle.write(_ data:)` vs `FileHandle.write(contentsOf:)`**: Legacy `.write(data)` throws uncatchable Objective-C NSExceptions on disk-full. Modern `.write(contentsOf:)` throws Swift errors.
   - **VCSE streaming encryption format**: Files >1MB use chunked AES-GCM (256KB chunks). Files ≤1MB use single-shot encryption.
   - **Atomic manifest pattern**: Share extension writes `manifest.json` LAST so main app only sees complete batches.
   - **VaultTheme color tokens**: `vaultBackground` (#D1D1E9 light / #20233C dark navy), `vaultSurface` (#FFFFFE / #323444 slate).

3. Files and Code Sections:

   - **`apps/ios/Vault/Features/Onboarding/PatternSetupView.swift`**
     - Added `Color.vaultBackground.ignoresSafeArea()` to fix black background in dark mode
     ```swift
     .padding()
     .background(Color.vaultBackground.ignoresSafeArea())
     .overlay {
     ```

   - **`apps/ios/Vault/Features/VaultViewer/VaultView.swift`**
     - Added `.preferredColorScheme()` on settings fullScreenCover to fix immediate appearance mode updates
     ```swift
     .fullScreenCover(isPresented: $showingSettings) {
         NavigationStack {
             VaultSettingsView()
         }
         .preferredColorScheme(appState.appearanceMode.preferredColorScheme)
     }
     ```

   - **`apps/ios/Vault/Extensions/ShareExtension/ShareViewController.swift`** (most critical file)
     - Complete rewrite of memory-sensitive sections
     - Added `isProcessing` guard to prevent double-invocation
     - Added error handling for KeyDerivation failure
     - Replaced UIImage thumbnail with CGImageSource
     - Wrapped synchronous work in autoreleasepool
     - Released receivedItems after processing
     - Full current state of key methods:
     ```swift
     // State
     private var receivedItems: [NSExtensionItem] = []
     private var isProcessing = false

     // Pattern delegate with guard and error handling
     func patternComplete(_ pattern: [Int]) {
         guard !isProcessing else { return }
         isProcessing = true
         Task {
             do {
                 let key = try await KeyDerivation.deriveKey(from: pattern, gridSize: VaultCoreConstants.gridSize)
                 await MainActor.run {
                     self.processSharedContent(with: key)
                 }
             } catch {
                 await MainActor.run {
                     self.isProcessing = false
                     self.showError()
                 }
             }
         }
     }

         let (encryptedSize, hasThumbnail) = try autoreleasepool {
             let encryptedURL = batchURL.appendingPathComponent("\(fileId.uuidString).enc")

             return (encSize, hasThumb)
         }
         return StagedFileMetadata(...)
     }

     // After processing loop, release provider references
     let sourceApp = receivedItems.first?.attributedContentText.map { _ in
         Bundle.main.bundleIdentifier
     } ?? nil
     receivedItems = []

     // CGImageSource thumbnail (replaces UIImage-based version)
     private func generateThumbnail(from url: URL) -> Data? {
         let maxDimension: CGFloat = 200
         guard let source = CGImageSourceCreateWithURL(url as CFURL, nil) else { return nil }
         let options: [CFString: Any] = [
             kCGImageSourceCreateThumbnailFromImageAlways: true,
             kCGImageSourceCreateThumbnailWithTransform: true,
             kCGImageSourceThumbnailMaxPixelSize: maxDimension,
         ]
         guard let cgImage = CGImageSourceCreateThumbnailAtIndex(source, 0, options as CFDictionary) else {
             return nil
         }
         let uiImage = UIImage(cgImage: cgImage)
         return uiImage.jpegData(compressionQuality: 0.6)
     }
     ```

   - **`apps/ios/Vault/Core/Crypto/CryptoEngine.swift`**
     - Changed `encryptFileStreamingToHandle` to use throwing `write(contentsOf:)` instead of non-throwing `write(_:)` to prevent uncatchable NSException crashes on disk-full
     - All `handle.write(data)` calls replaced with `try handle.write(contentsOf: data)` in this method
     - NOTE: Decryption methods (`decryptStreamingToFile` line 335, `decryptStreamingFromHandleToFile` line 380) still use the non-throwing `handle.write(decrypted)` — these are main-app-only paths, not share extension
     ```swift
     static func encryptFileStreamingToHandle(from sourceURL: URL, to handle: FileHandle, with key: Data) throws {
         guard key.count == 32 else { throw CryptoError.keyGenerationFailed }
         let fileSize = try FileManager.default.attributesOfItem(atPath: sourceURL.path)[.size] as? Int ?? 0

         if fileSize <= VaultCoreConstants.streamingThreshold {
             let data = try Data(contentsOf: sourceURL)
             let encrypted = try encrypt(data, with: key)
             try handle.write(contentsOf: encrypted)
             return
         }

         // ... streaming header writes all use try handle.write(contentsOf:) ...

         for chunkIndex in 0..<totalChunks {
             // ... encrypt chunk ...
             var encSize = UInt32(combined.count)
             try handle.write(contentsOf: Data(bytes: &encSize, count: 4))
             try handle.write(contentsOf: combined)
         }
     }
     ```

     - `apps/ios/Vault/Features/Settings/RecoveryPhraseView.swift` — added vaultBackground
     - `apps/ios/Vault/Features/Settings/VaultSettingsView.swift` — added vaultBackground to ChangePatternView and CustomRecoveryPhraseInputView, added `.scrollContentBackground(.hidden)` to TextEditor
     - `apps/ios/Vault/Features/Sharing/JoinVaultView.swift` — added `.scrollContentBackground(.hidden)` to TextEditor
     - `apps/ios/Vault/Features/PatternLock/PatternLockView.swift` — added `.scrollContentBackground(.hidden)` to RecoveryPhraseInputView TextEditor

4. Errors and Fixes:
   - **Appearance mode not updating immediately**: UIKit `overrideUserInterfaceStyle` doesn't trigger SwiftUI re-render. Fixed by adding `.preferredColorScheme()` directly on the fullScreenCover content.
   - **Share extension crash — UIImage thumbnail memory**: `UIImage(contentsOfFile:)` loads ~48MB per 12MP photo, exceeding 120MB extension limit. Fixed with CGImageSource which downsamples without full decode (~200KB).
   - **Share extension — no autoreleasepool**: UIKit/Foundation temporaries accumulated across iterations. Fixed by wrapping synchronous work in `autoreleasepool` inside `processAttachment`.
   - **Share extension — double-invocation race**: `patternComplete` could fire twice before UI disabled pattern view. Fixed with `isProcessing` guard.
   - **Share extension — silent KeyDerivation error**: Error in Task was silently swallowed, freezing UI. Fixed with try/catch that shows error UI.
   - **Share extension — NSItemProvider cache retention**: `receivedItems` held strong references throughout. Fixed by clearing after processing loop.
   - **CryptoEngine `FileHandle.write` non-throwing**: Legacy `write(_ data:)` throws uncatchable Objective-C NSException on disk-full. Fixed by switching to `try handle.write(contentsOf:)` in `encryptFileStreamingToHandle`.
   - **SourceKit false positive diagnostics**: "Cannot find 'SentryManager' in scope", "Cannot find 'VaultCoreConstants' in scope" — these are cross-file SourceKit resolution issues, not real build errors. Verified by actual xcodebuild succeeding.
   - **`autoreleasepool` with async**: Initially tried wrapping `try await` in `autoreleasepool` but `autoreleasepool` only takes synchronous closures. Fixed by putting autoreleasepool inside `processAttachment` around synchronous-only work.

5. Problem Solving:
   - **Background unification**: Systematically identified all screens missing `vaultBackground` or with opaque TextEditor backgrounds by cross-referencing user screenshots with code.
   - **Appearance mode**: Traced the SwiftUI update chain from `@Observable` change → `.preferredColorScheme()` modifier → fullScreenCover content. Identified that fullScreenCovers need their own `.preferredColorScheme()` since the root view's modifier doesn't propagate through.
   - **Share extension memory**: Performed complete memory audit of entire data flow. Mapped peak memory per operation. Found CGImageSource as the key fix (100x reduction for thumbnails). Added autoreleasepool for ObjC temporaries. Identified FileHandle.write crash vector.
   - **Comprehensive extension review**: Traced data flow for worst-case scenarios (100 photos at 5MB each, 10 videos at 200MB each). Verified memory stays under 120MB limit. Found and fixed FileHandle.write non-throwing crash risk.

6. All User Messages:
   - "The appearance functionality is not working well. Watch the video /Users/nan/Downloads/ScreenRecording_02-14-2026\ 22-15-50_1.MP4 When I change it nothing happens until I fully exit to the vault view. This should apply immediately"
   - "The share extension is still crashing at large amount of files or large files. Either way the experience is not good. We need to figure out a way to make it work."
   - "I want you to review one more time this code so we don't deploy it to crash again"
   - "Ok. One more time. Review all the extension's code and make sure large and large amount of files can be processed properly"

7. Pending Tasks:
   - **Build and verify** the CryptoEngine `FileHandle.write(contentsOf:)` changes compile cleanly
   - **Commit and push** the CryptoEngine changes
   - **Consider fixing** remaining non-throwing `handle.write(decrypted)` calls in decryption methods (lines 335, 380) — these are main-app paths but have the same disk-full crash risk
   - **Session close protocol**: git add, bd sync, git commit, git push, update scratch-pad

8. Current Work:
   Was in the middle of a comprehensive review of ALL share extension code per user's request "Ok. One more time. Review all the extension's code and make sure large and large amount of files can be processed properly." 
   
   Found and fixed the `FileHandle.write` non-throwing crash risk in `CryptoEngine.encryptFileStreamingToHandle` — replaced all `handle.write(data)` with `try handle.write(contentsOf: data)`.
   
   The edit has been made to `apps/ios/Vault/Core/Crypto/CryptoEngine.swift` but has NOT been built, committed, or pushed yet. The last grep output showed SourceKit diagnostics (false positives) and the remaining non-throwing `handle.write(decrypted)` at line 335 in `decryptStreamingToFile`.

9. Optional Next Step:
   Build to verify the CryptoEngine changes compile, then also fix the remaining `handle.write(decrypted)` calls at lines 335 and 380 in the decryption streaming methods (same crash risk on disk-full), then commit and push all changes. The user explicitly asked to "Review all the extension's code and make sure large and large amount of files can be processed properly" — the CryptoEngine fix is part of completing that review.
