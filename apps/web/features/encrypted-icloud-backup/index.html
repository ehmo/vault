          <h1>Encrypted iCloud Backup: Cloud Storage Without Trust</h1>
          <p class="hero-lead">Your vault can live in iCloud without Apple ever seeing what is inside. Vaultaire encrypts everything on your device before uploading a single byte. What reaches Apple's servers is indistinguishable from random noise. The key stays with you.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- Section 1: What It Is -->
        <h2>What Is Encrypted iCloud Backup?</h2>

        <p>Phones break. Phones get lost. Phones get stolen. If your most private files exist only on a single device, they are one accident away from being gone forever. Backup solves this &mdash; but traditional cloud backup creates a different problem: now a company you do not control has a readable copy of your files.</p>

        <p>Vaultaire takes a third path. You can optionally back up your vault to iCloud, but the data is encrypted locally &mdash; on your device, with your vault's encryption key &mdash; before it ever leaves your phone. What gets uploaded to Apple's servers is a blob of encrypted data that looks like random noise. Apple cannot read it. Apple's employees cannot read it. A hacker who breaches Apple's servers cannot read it. A government agency that subpoenas Apple cannot read it.</p>

        <p>The encryption happens before the upload, not during and not after. This is the critical distinction. Many cloud services encrypt data &ldquo;in transit&rdquo; (while it travels to their servers) and &ldquo;at rest&rdquo; (while it sits on their servers). But in both cases, the service holds the key. They can decrypt your data anytime they choose. With Vaultaire, the key never leaves your device. Apple is simply storing a box they cannot open.</p>

        <div class="info-box">
          <div class="info-box-label">Not &ldquo;Encrypted in iCloud&rdquo; &mdash; Encrypted Before iCloud</div>
          <p>Apple encrypts iCloud data with keys that Apple controls. Vaultaire encrypts your data with a key derived from your pattern &mdash; a key that <strong>only exists on your device, only while the app is open</strong>. These are fundamentally different security models. Apple's encryption protects you from outsiders. Vaultaire's encryption protects you from everyone, including Apple.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- Section 2: How It Works -->
        <h2>How It Works, Step by Step</h2>

        <p>The mechanics are straightforward. The security comes not from complexity but from the order of operations &mdash; encryption happens first, upload happens second, and the key never travels with the data.</p>

        <h3>Step 1: Your Vault Is Encrypted Locally</h3>

        <p>When you enable iCloud backup, Vaultaire takes your vault's contents &mdash; every photo, video, document, and piece of metadata &mdash; and encrypts them using the same AES-256-GCM encryption that protects your vault during normal use. The encryption key is derived from your drawn pattern through PBKDF2 key derivation. This is the same key that encrypts your files on-device. No separate backup key, no additional passwords, no extra steps.</p>

        <h3>Step 2: The Encrypted Blob Goes to iCloud</h3>

        <p>The encrypted output &mdash; a single package of data that is mathematically indistinguishable from random noise &mdash; is uploaded to your iCloud storage. From Apple's perspective, it is just a file. They store it, replicate it across their data centers for reliability, and include it in your standard iCloud storage quota. They have no idea what is inside, because what is inside is noise without the key.</p>

        <h3>Step 3: The Key Stays on Your Device</h3>

        <p>At no point during this process does the encryption key leave your device. It is not transmitted to Apple, not stored in iCloud Keychain, and not embedded in the backup file. The key exists only in volatile memory while Vaultaire is open and is wiped when the app closes. The backup in iCloud is a locked box, and the only key exists in the pattern you carry in your muscle memory.</p>

          </div>
        </div>

        <!-- Section 3: Why Apple Can't Read It -->
        <h2>Why Apple Cannot Read Your Backup</h2>

        <p>This is not a matter of policy. It is not a promise Apple makes in a terms-of-service document. It is mathematics.</p>

        <p>AES-256-GCM encryption produces output that is computationally indistinguishable from random data. Without the correct 256-bit key, there is no algorithm, no shortcut, and no amount of computing power that can reverse the encryption. The best attack against AES-256 is brute force &mdash; trying every possible key &mdash; and there are 2<sup>256</sup> possible keys. That number is larger than the estimated number of atoms in the observable universe.</p>

        <p>Apple does not have the key. Apple has never had the key. The key is derived from your pattern on your device, used to encrypt locally, and then discarded from memory. What Apple receives is the encrypted output, and the encrypted output alone tells them nothing about what is inside.</p>

        <h3>Even with a Court Order</h3>

        <p>When law enforcement serves Apple with a subpoena or court order for iCloud data, Apple can comply by handing over whatever they have. For standard iCloud data, that means readable files &mdash; photos, messages, documents. For a Vaultaire backup, what Apple hands over is an encrypted blob. They cannot decrypt it because they do not possess the key. They cannot produce the key because they never had it. The court order hits a mathematical wall.</p>

        <p>This is not defiance of law enforcement. It is the architectural reality of end-to-end encryption where the user holds the only key. Apple can hand over exactly what they have. What they have is useless without your pattern.</p>

        </div>

        <!-- Section 4: The Trust Model -->
        <h2>The Trust Model: Trust Math, Not Companies</h2>

        <p>Traditional cloud storage requires you to trust the provider. You trust that they encrypt your data properly. You trust that they do not peek at your files. You trust that they will resist government pressure. You trust that their employees will not abuse their access. That is a lot of trust to place in an organization you have never met.</p>

        <p>Vaultaire's encrypted iCloud backup eliminates the need for trust entirely. The security does not depend on Apple's policies, Apple's ethics, or Apple's competence at securing their infrastructure. It depends on AES-256, a publicly audited encryption standard that has withstood decades of cryptanalysis by the world's best mathematicians and intelligence agencies.</p>

        <p>If Apple's servers are breached, your data is safe &mdash; because the attacker gets encrypted noise. If a rogue Apple employee accesses your files, your data is safe &mdash; because they see encrypted noise. If Apple changes their privacy policy tomorrow, your data is safe &mdash; because policy does not override mathematics. The encryption protects you regardless of who stores the data, how they store it, or what they do with their access.</p>

        <p>You do not need to trust Apple. You do not need to trust Vaultaire. You only need to trust the math, and the math has been public knowledge for decades.</p>

        <!-- Section 5: Recovery from a New Device -->
        <h2>Recovering Your Vault on a New Device</h2>

        <p>This is where encrypted backup proves its value. Your phone is gone &mdash; lost, broken, stolen, upgraded. Your vault was backed up to iCloud. Here is what happens next.</p>

        <h3>Step 1: Install Vaultaire on Your New Device</h3>

        <p>Download Vaultaire from the App Store on your new iPhone or iPad. The app detects that an encrypted backup exists in your iCloud account.</p>

        <h3>Step 2: Draw Your Pattern</h3>

        <p>Vaultaire presents the familiar 5&times;5 grid. You draw the same pattern you have always used. The app derives the same encryption key through the same key derivation process &mdash; same pattern, same salt (stored in the backup metadata), same key.</p>

        <h3>Step 3: Your Vault Decrypts</h3>

        <p>The encrypted backup is downloaded from iCloud and decrypted locally on your new device. Your photos, videos, and documents reappear exactly as you left them. The entire process takes seconds for small vaults and minutes for large ones. At no point during this process did Apple or anyone else have access to your unencrypted data.</p>

        <p>If you also have a secret recovery phrase, you can use that instead of the pattern. Either method regenerates the same encryption key. The flexibility exists so that you have multiple paths back to your data &mdash; but every path requires something only you know.</p>

        <div class="info-box">
          <div class="info-box-label">What If You Forget Your Pattern and Recovery Phrase?</div>
          <p>If you lose both your pattern and your recovery phrase, the iCloud backup cannot be decrypted. Not by you, not by Vaultaire, not by Apple, not by anyone. This is the cost of genuine security: <strong>the same math that keeps everyone else out keeps you out too if you lose the key</strong>. This is why Vaultaire prompts you to save your recovery phrase in a safe place when you first create your vault.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- Section 6: Optional by Design -->
        <h2>Off by Default, On by Choice</h2>

        <p>Encrypted iCloud backup is disabled by default. This is a deliberate design decision, not an oversight.</p>

        <p>Some people do not want their data to leave their device under any circumstances. They accept the risk of a single point of failure because the alternative &mdash; any copy existing anywhere else &mdash; is unacceptable to them. Vaultaire respects this position. If you never enable iCloud backup, your vault exists only on your device. No cloud, no copies, no third-party involvement of any kind.</p>

        <p>When you enable iCloud backup, you are making an informed choice. You are accepting that an encrypted copy of your data will reside on Apple's servers in exchange for the ability to recover your vault if you lose your device. The copy is encrypted, the key stays with you, and Apple cannot read the contents &mdash; but the copy exists. That tradeoff is yours to make, and Vaultaire does not make it for you.</p>

        <p>You can disable iCloud backup at any time. When you do, Vaultaire removes the encrypted backup from iCloud. Your vault returns to being purely local.</p>

        <!-- Section 7: Sync vs Backup -->
        <h2>Backup, Not Sync</h2>

        <p>It is important to understand what encrypted iCloud backup is not. It is not real-time synchronization between devices. It is not a live mirror of your vault that updates every time you add a photo.</p>

        <p>Encrypted iCloud backup is a point-in-time snapshot. When you trigger a backup (or when Vaultaire performs a scheduled backup), the app encrypts your vault's current state and uploads it to iCloud. If you add files after the backup, those files will not appear in the backup until the next one runs. If you restore from a backup, you get the vault as it existed at the time of that backup.</p>

        <p>This is by design. Real-time sync introduces complexity &mdash; conflict resolution, partial state management, incremental encryption &mdash; that creates potential attack surfaces. A backup is a clean, complete snapshot: encrypt everything, upload everything, done. Simpler architecture means fewer things that can go wrong, fewer edge cases for attackers to exploit, and a recovery process you can reason about with confidence.</p>

        <p>Think of it like a safety deposit box. You do not continuously shuttle documents back and forth. You place a copy of your important files in the box, and if your house burns down, you go to the bank and retrieve them. The originals live with you. The backup waits quietly until you need it.</p>

          <details class="feature-faq-item">
            <summary>Does the iCloud backup count against my iCloud storage?</summary>
            <div class="faq-answer">
              <p>Yes. The encrypted backup is stored as a file in your iCloud account and counts toward your iCloud storage quota. The size of the backup corresponds to the size of your vault's encrypted contents. Since encryption does not significantly change file size, a vault with 2 GB of photos will produce a backup of roughly 2 GB.</p>
            </div>
          </details>

          <details class="feature-faq-item">
            <summary>How often does Vaultaire back up to iCloud?</summary>
            <div class="faq-answer">
              <p>Vaultaire backs up when you manually trigger a backup or when the app detects significant changes to your vault while on Wi-Fi and power. You can also configure backup frequency in the app's settings. Every backup is a full encrypted snapshot &mdash; not an incremental update &mdash; ensuring consistency and simplicity.</p>
            </div>
          </details>

          <details class="feature-faq-item">
            <summary>Can I use this backup on a different Apple ID?</summary>
            <div class="faq-answer">
              <p>The encrypted backup is tied to your iCloud account. If you sign in with a different Apple ID, you will not see the backup. However, if you transfer the encrypted backup file manually (for example, via AirDrop or a computer), any device running Vaultaire can decrypt it &mdash; provided you draw the correct pattern or enter the correct recovery phrase. The encryption is keyed to your pattern, not to your Apple ID.</p>
            </div>
          </details>

          <details class="feature-faq-item">
            <summary>What happens if Apple deletes my iCloud data?</summary>
            <div class="faq-answer">
              <p>If Apple removes your iCloud data (due to account termination, unpaid storage, or any other reason), the backup is gone. Your on-device vault remains unaffected. This is why iCloud backup is a safety net, not a replacement for your local vault. The primary copy always lives on your device.</p>
            </div>
          </details>

          <details class="feature-faq-item">
            <summary>Is the backup encrypted with a different key than my on-device vault?</summary>
            <div class="faq-answer">
              <p>No. The backup uses the same AES-256-GCM encryption with the same key derived from your pattern. This means one pattern unlocks everything &mdash; your local vault and your iCloud backup. There is no separate backup password to remember. Your pattern is your key to all of it.</p>
            </div>
          </details>

          <details class="feature-faq-item">
            <summary>Can Vaultaire's developers access my iCloud backup?</summary>
            <div class="faq-answer">
              <p>No. Vaultaire operates on a zero-knowledge architecture. The developers never see your pattern, never generate your key, and never have access to your backup or its contents. The backup is encrypted on your device with a key only you can produce. Even if Vaultaire's entire infrastructure were compromised, your iCloud backup would remain secure because the key was never part of that infrastructure.</p>
