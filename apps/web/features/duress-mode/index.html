          <h1>Duress Mode: Emergency Vault Destruction</h1>
          <p class="hero-lead">You are being forced to unlock your phone. Someone is watching. You draw a pattern on the grid, and a vault opens. It looks normal. But behind the scenes, every other vault on your device has just been permanently destroyed. The encryption keys are gone. The data is now random noise. And nobody saw a thing.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- Section 1: What Is Duress Mode -->
        <h2>What Is Duress Mode?</h2>

        <p>Duress Mode is the last line of defense. It is a feature you hope you never need, designed for the moment when everything else has failed &mdash; when someone is standing over you, demanding access to your private files, and you have no choice but to comply.</p>

        <p>Here is how it works: you designate one vault as your duress vault. You fill it with content that looks believable &mdash; a few harmless photos, some mundane documents. Then you assign it a pattern, just like any other vault. From the outside, it is indistinguishable from a normal vault.</p>

        <p>The difference is what happens when you draw that pattern. A normal vault pattern decrypts the files inside that vault, and nothing else. The duress pattern does that too &mdash; it opens the duress vault, showing its contents on screen. But simultaneously, silently, in the background, it triggers the cryptographic destruction of every other vault on your device.</p>

        <p>No confirmation dialog appears. No warning sound plays. No loading spinner suggests anything unusual is happening. The person watching you sees a vault open. They see photos. They see exactly what they expected to see. What they do not see is that every other piece of encrypted data on your device just became permanently unrecoverable.</p>

        <div class="info-box">
          <div class="info-box-label">The Nuclear Option</div>
          <p>Duress Mode is not a privacy feature. It is a <strong>survival feature</strong>. It exists because there are situations where the cost of someone accessing your data exceeds the cost of losing it forever. When you draw the duress pattern, you are making that trade &mdash; deliberately, silently, and irreversibly.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- Section 2: How It Works -->
        <h2>How It Works Under the Hood</h2>

        <p>Understanding the mechanics matters, because the security of Duress Mode depends on its implementation being genuinely destructive &mdash; not just cosmetically hidden.</p>

        <h3>Step 1: You Draw the Duress Pattern</h3>

        <p>When you draw the pattern assigned to your duress vault, Vaultaire recognizes it as a duress trigger. The app begins two operations simultaneously: it starts decrypting and displaying the duress vault's contents (the decoy), and it initiates the destruction sequence for every other vault.</p>

        <h3>Step 2: Encryption Keys Are Wiped</h3>

        <p>Each vault in Vaultaire is encrypted with its own unique key, derived from its own unique pattern. Those keys are not stored in plaintext &mdash; they are regenerated from the pattern each time. But each vault also stores a salt and metadata needed for the key derivation process. Duress Mode does not just delete the encrypted files. It destroys the cryptographic salt and key derivation parameters for every non-duress vault.</p>

        <p>Without the salt, even drawing the correct pattern cannot regenerate the key. The mathematical link between your pattern and the encryption key is severed permanently.</p>

        <h3>Step 3: Encrypted Data Becomes Noise</h3>

        <p>The encrypted files themselves may still exist on disk momentarily, but they are now indistinguishable from random data. Without the correct decryption key &mdash; which can no longer be derived because the salt is gone &mdash; the contents are mathematically unrecoverable. No forensic tool, no government agency, no amount of computing power can reconstruct the original data.</p>

        <h3>Step 4: The Duress Vault Opens Normally</h3>

        <p>While all of this is happening, the duress vault opens on screen exactly the way any vault would. The person coercing you sees photos loading, files appearing, a normal-looking vault experience. There is no visual evidence that anything else occurred. The entire destruction sequence completes in the background, typically in under a second.</p>

        <div class="stat-row">
          <div class="stat-card">
            <div class="stat-value">&lt;1s</div>
            <div class="stat-label">Time to Destroy All Keys</div>
          </div>
          <div class="stat-card">
            <div class="stat-value">0</div>
            <div class="stat-label">Visual Indicators</div>
          </div>
          <div class="stat-card">
            <div class="stat-value">0%</div>
            <div class="stat-label">Recovery Chance</div>
          </div>
        </div>

        <!-- Section 3: Silent Operation -->
        <h2>Why Nobody Can Tell</h2>

        <p>The entire point of Duress Mode is that it is invisible. If an attacker could detect the destruction, they could stop it, reverse it, or punish you for triggering it. Vaultaire is designed so that no observable difference exists between opening a duress vault and opening a regular vault.</p>

        <h3>No Confirmation Dialog</h3>

        <p>Most destructive actions in software come with a warning: "Are you sure?" Duress Mode has no such warning. A confirmation dialog would be a dead giveaway. The moment you draw the pattern, the action is taken. You cannot accidentally trigger it unless you accidentally draw a specific, complex pattern on a 5&times;5 grid &mdash; which is not something that happens by chance.</p>

        <h3>No Timing Difference</h3>

        <p>The duress vault opens at the same speed as any other vault. The destruction of other vaults' keys happens asynchronously, in parallel with the decryption of the duress vault's contents. An observer with a stopwatch would notice no delay.</p>

        <h3>No Residual Evidence</h3>

        <p>After Duress Mode triggers, the app shows no record of the event. There is no log entry, no "vaults deleted" notification, no change in the app's interface. The next time the app opens, it behaves as though the duress vault is the only vault that has ever existed. Because, functionally, it is.</p>

        <!-- Section 4: What Gets Destroyed -->
        <h2>What Gets Destroyed</h2>

        <p>Precision matters here. Duress Mode does not perform a theatrical deletion where files are moved to a trash folder. It performs a cryptographic wipe that makes recovery physically impossible.</p>

        <h3>The Cryptographic Salt</h3>

        <p>Every vault has a unique, randomly generated salt used during key derivation. The salt is the critical ingredient that connects your drawn pattern to a specific encryption key. When Duress Mode destroys the salt, it severs that connection permanently. Even if you remember every other vault's pattern, the key derivation function will produce a different &mdash; wrong &mdash; key without the original salt.</p>

        <h3>Key Derivation Parameters</h3>

        <p>Beyond the salt, each vault stores parameters needed for key derivation: iteration counts, algorithm identifiers, and initialization vectors. All of these are wiped. Without them, reconstruction of the encryption key is not merely difficult &mdash; it is mathematically undefined.</p>

        <h3>The Encrypted Data</h3>

        <p>The encrypted blobs on disk become orphaned. They are sequences of bytes that, without the correct key, are indistinguishable from data generated by a random number generator. Forensic analysis of the disk will find encrypted data with no corresponding key material, no salt, and no metadata. It looks exactly like disk sectors that were once used and then freed &mdash; which is exactly what it is.</p>

        <div class="info-box">
          <div class="info-box-label">Forensic Reality</div>
          <p>A forensic examiner analyzing a device after Duress Mode has triggered will find one vault with normal data and some orphaned encrypted blocks on disk. There is <strong>no way to determine</strong> whether those blocks were from deleted vaults, cached app data, or normal filesystem churn. The examiner cannot even prove that additional vaults ever existed.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- Section 5: When to Use It -->
        <h2>When to Use Duress Mode</h2>

        <p>Duress Mode is designed for situations where you face physical coercion or legal compulsion and have decided that data destruction is preferable to data exposure. This is a personal decision with serious implications, and Vaultaire gives you the tool without making the decision for you.</p>

        <h3>Border Crossings</h3>

        <p>In many countries, border agents can legally demand that you unlock your device and hand it over for inspection. If you refuse, you may be detained, denied entry, or have your device confiscated. Drawing the duress pattern before handing over your phone ensures there is nothing to find &mdash; just one vault with some holiday photos.</p>

        <h3>Physical Coercion</h3>

        <p>If someone is forcing you to unlock your phone under threat, you need a way to comply without actually giving them what they want. Duress Mode lets you draw a pattern that looks like cooperation. The coercer sees a vault open. They do not see the simultaneous destruction of everything else.</p>

        <h3>Device Seizure</h3>

        <p>If you have reason to believe your device will be confiscated &mdash; whether by a government, an employer, or anyone else &mdash; you can trigger Duress Mode proactively. By the time the device reaches a forensic analyst, there is nothing left to analyze.</p>

        <h3>Journalist and Source Protection</h3>

        <p>Journalists working in hostile environments, activists operating under surveillance, and anyone whose data could endanger themselves or others. Duress Mode turns a moment of vulnerability into a moment of protection.</p>

        <!-- Section 6: Setting It Up -->
        <h2>Setting Up Your Duress Vault</h2>

        <p>Configuring Duress Mode takes about two minutes. Doing it well &mdash; making it convincing &mdash; takes a bit more thought.</p>

        <h3>Designate the Vault</h3>

        <p>In Vaultaire's settings, you designate one vault as the duress vault. This vault will be the one that opens when the duress pattern is drawn, so it needs to contain content that looks real and satisfies an observer's expectations. An empty vault is suspicious. A vault with clearly fake content is suspicious. A vault with a handful of normal-looking personal photos is perfect.</p>

        <h3>Stock It With Believable Content</h3>

        <p>Put content in your duress vault that someone would expect to find in a private vault: a few personal photos, maybe a scan of a document, some files that look private enough to justify locking but innocuous enough to survive scrutiny. The goal is not to fool a forensic investigation &mdash; it is to satisfy the person standing in front of you in the moment.</p>

        <h3>Choose a Natural Pattern</h3>

        <p>The duress pattern should be something you can draw under stress, quickly, without hesitation. If you fumble or draw it wrong, you will open the wrong vault or no vault at all. Practice it until it is muscle memory. This is not the time for a complex 12-dot pattern. Something simple and fast is better &mdash; 5 to 7 dots, a shape your hand can trace without thinking.</p>

        <h3>Test It</h3>

        <p>Before you ever need it, test Duress Mode in a safe environment. Create some test vaults, designate a duress vault, and trigger it. Verify that the other vaults are gone. Verify that the duress vault opened normally. Then set it up for real.</p>

        <!-- Section 7: Irreversibility -->
        <h2>There Is No Undo</h2>

        <p>This needs to be said clearly: once Duress Mode triggers, the destruction is permanent. There is no recovery. There is no "Oops, I drew the wrong pattern" safety net. There is no backup key stored on a server somewhere. There is no way for Vaultaire support to restore your data.</p>

        <p>The encryption keys are gone. The salts are gone. The data is random noise. This is the point. If the destruction were reversible, it would not be destruction &mdash; it would be hiding. And hiding is something a sufficiently motivated adversary can undo.</p>

        <p>Duress Mode is designed for people who understand this trade-off and have decided, in advance, that they would rather lose their data permanently than let someone else access it. If you are not certain you would make that trade, do not enable Duress Mode. If you are certain, it is the most powerful protection Vaultaire offers.</p>

        <p>The irreversibility is not a flaw. It is the entire point. A destructive action that can be undone is not destructive &mdash; it is theatrical. Duress Mode is not theater. It is a guarantee.</p>

            <summary>What happens if I accidentally draw the duress pattern?</summary>
            <div class="faq-answer">
              <p>The destruction triggers immediately and cannot be reversed. This is why Vaultaire requires the duress pattern to be a deliberate, specific pattern on a 5&times;5 grid &mdash; accidental replication is extremely unlikely. That said, it is your responsibility to choose a duress pattern that you will not draw by mistake. Never use a pattern similar to one of your regular vault patterns.</p>

          <details class="feature-faq-item">
            <summary>Can I recover my vaults from an iCloud backup after triggering Duress Mode?</summary>
            <div class="faq-answer">
              <p>If you had encrypted iCloud backups enabled before triggering Duress Mode, those backups still contain the encrypted vault data and the key derivation parameters. Restoring from a backup made before the duress event would recover your vaults. However, if the backup syncs after Duress Mode triggers, the backup will reflect the destroyed state. If you anticipate needing Duress Mode, ensure your backup strategy accounts for this.</p>
            </div>
          </details>

          <details class="feature-faq-item">
            <summary>Can a forensic analyst tell that Duress Mode was triggered?</summary>
            <div class="faq-answer">
              <p>No. After Duress Mode triggers, the device shows a single vault with normal content. There is no log, no record, and no metadata indicating that other vaults existed or were destroyed. Orphaned encrypted blocks on disk are indistinguishable from normal filesystem artifacts. A forensic analyst would have no evidence to suggest that Duress Mode was ever enabled, let alone triggered.</p>
            </div>
          </details>

          <details class="feature-faq-item">
            <summary>Does the duress vault itself get destroyed?</summary>
            <div class="faq-answer">
              <p>No. The duress vault remains intact and fully functional. It opens normally, displays its contents, and continues to work as a regular vault after the event. This is essential &mdash; if the vault you just "unlocked" disappeared, the person coercing you would know something happened. The duress vault persists to maintain the illusion of normal operation.</p>
            </div>
          </details>

          <details class="feature-faq-item">
            <summary>Can I have multiple duress vaults?</summary>
            <div class="faq-answer">
              <p>No. You designate exactly one vault as the duress vault. This constraint is intentional &mdash; having multiple duress triggers would increase the risk of accidental activation and complicate the mental model. One vault, one pattern, one outcome.</p>
            </div>
          </details>

          <details class="feature-faq-item">
            <summary>Is Duress Mode legal?</summary>
            <div class="faq-answer">
              <p>Vaultaire provides tools for data security. How and when you use those tools is your decision and your responsibility. Destroying your own data is generally legal in most jurisdictions, but laws vary &mdash; particularly around evidence destruction during legal proceedings.
