          <span class="feature-hero-icon" aria-hidden="true">&#x2728;</span>
          <h1>Ease of Use: Military-Grade Encryption Made Simple</h1>
          <p class="hero-lead">The most secure app in the world is useless if nobody can figure out how to use it. Vaultaire is built on a simple conviction: real security should feel effortless. No accounts. No configuration. No learning curve. Just draw a pattern, add your files, and they are protected by AES-256 encryption.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- Section 1: The Paradox -->
        <h2>The False Choice Between Security and Simplicity</h2>

        <p>There is a long-standing assumption in the security world: the more secure something is, the harder it must be to use. Encrypted email requires PGP keys, key servers, and a manual that reads like a doctoral thesis. Full-disk encryption demands long passphrases and recovery procedures. Password managers need master passwords, browser extensions, vault syncing, and account creation.</p>

        <p>The result? Most people give up. They use the same weak password everywhere. They store private photos in their camera roll. They tell themselves it probably won't happen to them. And who can blame them? The tools designed to protect them were designed by engineers who forgot that normal people have better things to do than manage cryptographic infrastructure.</p>

        <p>Vaultaire rejects this tradeoff entirely. Security and usability are not opposites &mdash; they are multipliers. An app that is easy to use gets used. An app that gets used actually protects people. The most mathematically secure vault in existence protects exactly zero files if its owner abandoned it after ten minutes of frustration.</p>

        <div class="info-box">
          <div class="info-box-label">The Usability Principle</div>
          <p>Security that people actually use will always beat stronger security that people abandon. Vaultaire is designed so that <strong>the easiest thing to do is also the most secure thing to do</strong>. There is no "advanced mode" to unlock. The default experience is the secure experience.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- Section 2: No Accounts, No Setup -->
        <h2>No Accounts. No Setup. No Friction.</h2>

        <p>Open Vaultaire for the first time. There is no sign-up screen. No email verification. No terms-of-service checkbox hiding a data-harvesting clause. No "create your account to get started" wall.</p>

        <p>You see a grid of dots. You draw a pattern. That is it. You have just created a vault protected by AES-256-GCM encryption with a key derived from your unique pattern through PBKDF2. You did not need to know any of those words. You just drew a shape with your finger.</p>

        <p>This zero-configuration design is not laziness &mdash; it is a deliberate architectural decision. Every account you create is a liability: a username and password stored on someone's server, waiting to appear in the next data breach. Every setup wizard is a place where people make mistakes, choose weak options, or skip steps they do not understand. Vaultaire eliminates all of it. There is no server. There is no account. There is nothing to configure because the defaults are already the strongest options available.</p>

        <p>You open the app. You draw a pattern. You start adding files. Three steps, three seconds, and you are running military-grade encryption on your personal device.</p>

        <!-- Section 3: Pattern as UX -->
        <h2>Drawing a Pattern: Security Through Muscle Memory</h2>

        <p>Passwords are a failed experiment in human-computer interaction. We know this because the most common password in the world is still "123456." People cannot remember long, random strings of characters, so they use short, predictable ones. They reuse them across sites. They write them on sticky notes. The entire password-manager industry exists because passwords are fundamentally incompatible with how human memory works.</p>

        <p>Patterns work differently. When you draw a shape on a grid, you are not memorizing a sequence of characters. You are learning a motor skill. The same way you remember how to ride a bicycle or sign your name, your hand learns the motion of your pattern. Cognitive scientists call this procedural memory, and it is far more durable than the declarative memory we use for passwords.</p>

        <p>After drawing your pattern three or four times, you stop thinking about it. Your thumb knows where to go. You can unlock your vault in under a second, without looking at the screen, without consciously recalling anything. That is not just convenient &mdash; it is more secure. A pattern you can draw without thinking is a pattern you will never simplify to something easier to remember. You will never downgrade it to "1234" because you keep forgetting the original.</p>

          </div>
        </div>

        <!-- Section 4: Import Anything -->
        <h2>Import Anything: Photos, Videos, Documents, Any File</h2>

        <p>Some vault apps only handle photos. Others support photos and videos but choke on PDFs. Still others require you to export files to a specific format before importing them. Vaultaire takes a different approach: if your iPhone can store it, Vaultaire can encrypt it.</p>

        <p>Photos, videos, documents, PDFs, spreadsheets, voice memos, scanned receipts, medical records, legal contracts &mdash; tap the add button, select your files, and they are encrypted immediately. There is no format conversion, no file-size limit warning, no "upgrade to Pro to unlock document support." The encryption engine does not care what kind of file it is processing. It encrypts bytes. All files are bytes.</p>

        <p>The import process uses the iOS share sheet and file picker, which means the interface is already familiar. You are not learning a new way to browse and select files. You are using the same gestures and menus you use everywhere else on your phone. The only difference is that when you select a file, it vanishes into an encrypted vault instead of landing in an unprotected folder.</p>

        <!-- Section 5: Instant Encryption -->
        <h2>Instant Encryption: No Button to Remember</h2>

        <p>In most security tools, encryption is a separate step. You add your files, and then you click "Encrypt." Or you close the app and hope it locks behind you. Or you manually toggle a lock switch. Every extra step is a chance for human error. Forget to lock the vault? Your files sit unprotected.</p>

        <p>Vaultaire encrypts files the moment they enter the vault. There is no encrypt button. There is no lock toggle. There is no "remember to secure your vault before closing" reminder. When you add a photo, it is encrypted before it finishes appearing in your vault's gallery. When you close the app, the encryption key is wiped from memory. When you reopen it, nothing is accessible until you draw your pattern again.</p>

        <p>This is encryption as a property of the system, not an action you take within it. You do not "do" encryption in Vaultaire. Encryption is simply what happens. It is as automatic as gravity. You never need to think about it, which means you can never forget to do it.</p>

        <div class="info-box">
          <div class="info-box-label">Always-On Encryption</div>
          <p>Files are encrypted at the moment of import using AES-256-GCM. The encryption key exists only in volatile memory while the app is open. Close the app, and the key vanishes. There is <strong>no state where your files are in the vault but unencrypted</strong>. The vault is either open (key in memory) or sealed (key gone).</p>
        </div>

        <!-- Section 6: Clean Interface -->
        <h2>A Clean Interface That Gets Out of Your Way</h2>

        <p>Open most security apps and you are greeted by a control panel that looks like it belongs in a submarine. Toggles for encryption algorithms. Dropdowns for key sizes. Settings pages with dozens of options you do not understand and are terrified to change.</p>

        <p>Vaultaire's interface is deliberately minimal. You see your vaults. You tap one. You see your files. You tap one to view it. You tap the add button to import more. That is the entire interface for daily use.</p>

        <p>This minimalism is not the result of cutting corners. It is the result of making decisions so that you do not have to. The encryption algorithm? AES-256-GCM, the strongest available. The key derivation? PBKDF2 with a high iteration count. The key size? 256 bits. These are not configurable because there is no reason to configure them. The best options are the only options. Offering weaker alternatives would not give you flexibility &mdash; it would give you the opportunity to make your vault less secure.</p>

        <p>Every element on screen serves a purpose. Every interaction leads somewhere useful. There are no tutorial overlays, no tip-of-the-day popups, no gamification badges for encrypting your tenth file. The app respects your time and your intelligence. It assumes you opened it to protect your files, not to become a cryptography enthusiast.</p>

        <!-- Section 7: Accessibility -->
        <h2>Security for Everyone, Not Just Experts</h2>

        <p>The people who need encryption the most are often the least equipped to navigate complex security software. A journalist protecting sources in a hostile country does not have time to debug key-exchange protocols. A domestic abuse survivor hiding evidence does not have the luxury of a setup wizard. A teenager protecting private photos does not have a background in information security.</p>

        <p>Vaultaire is built for these people. The pattern grid is large, high-contrast, and works with assistive technologies. The interface uses clear, simple language &mdash; no jargon, no acronyms, no assumed knowledge. The app works identically whether you are a cybersecurity professional or someone who has never heard the word "encryption" before.</p>

        <p>Accessibility is not a feature bolted on after launch. It is a design constraint applied from the first line of code. VoiceOver support, Dynamic Type, reduced-motion preferences, and sufficient color contrast are not afterthoughts &mdash; they are requirements. Because if security is a human right, then it has to work for all humans, not just the ones who read Hacker News.</p>

        <p>The goal is radical: anyone who can use a smartphone should be able to protect their most sensitive files with the same encryption strength used by intelligence agencies. No training required. No expertise assumed. Just open the app and start.</p>

          <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

          <details class="feature-faq-item">
            <summary>Do I need to create an account to use Vaultaire?</summary>
            <div class="faq-answer">
              <p>No. Vaultaire requires no account, no email address, and no personal information of any kind. You open the app, draw a pattern, and start adding files. There is no server storing your credentials because there are no credentials to store.</p>
            </div>
          </details>

          <details class="feature-faq-item">
            <summary>Is Vaultaire hard to learn?</summary>
            <div class="faq-answer">
              <p>If you can draw a shape with your finger and tap a button, you can use Vaultaire. The entire learning curve is about three seconds. There are no settings to configure, no modes to understand, and no manual to read. The app is designed so that the obvious thing to do is always the right thing to do.</p>
            </div>
          </details>

          <details class="feature-faq-item">
            <summary>What file types can I encrypt?</summary>
            <div class="faq-answer">
              <p>Any file type your iPhone can handle. Photos, videos, PDFs, documents, spreadsheets, voice memos, and any other file format. Vaultaire encrypts the raw file data regardless of format. If you can select it in the iOS file picker, you can encrypt it.</p>
            </div>
          </details>

          <details class="feature-faq-item">
            <summary>Do I need to remember to lock my vault?</summary>
            <div class="faq-answer">
              <p>No. Vaultaire automatically wipes the encryption key from memory when you close the app or switch away from it. There is no manual lock step. The vault seals itself the moment you stop using it. When you return, you draw your pattern to regenerate the key.</p>
            </div>
          </details>

          <details class="feature-faq-item">
            <summary>Is the simple interface less secure than apps with more settings?</summary>
            <div class="faq-answer">
              <p>The opposite. Vaultaire uses AES-256-GCM encryption and PBKDF2 key derivation &mdash; the strongest options available &mdash; as non-configurable defaults. Apps that let you choose weaker settings are giving you the opportunity to make mistakes. Vaultaire makes the most secure option the only option, so simplicity and security are the same thing.</p>
            </div>
          </details>

          <details class="feature-faq-item">
            <summary>Does Vaultaire work with accessibility features like VoiceOver?</summary>
            <div class="faq-answer">
              <p>Yes. Vaultaire is built with accessibility as a core requirement, not an afterthought. It supports VoiceOver, Dynamic Type, reduced motion, and meets WCAG contrast requirements. The pattern grid and all interactive elements are fully accessible. Security should work for everyone.</p>
