Implement the following plan:

# Auto Background iCloud Backup

## Context
Backups only trigger when the user visits the iCloud Backup settings screen and must stay on that screen until complete. This is because:
1. The auto-backup check lives in `iCloudBackupSettingsView.onAppear`
2. No background execution protection exists — backgrounding kills the backup
3. The vault key is wiped on `willResignActiveNotification`

## Approach
Trigger backup silently after vault unlock. Use `beginBackgroundTask` + captured key so it survives backgrounding. Follow the existing `BackgroundShareTransferManager` pattern exactly.

## Changes

### 1. `iCloudBackupManager.swift` — Add silent background backup method
- New method `performBackupIfNeeded(with key: Data)` that:
  - Checks `iCloudBackupEnabled` AppStorage and 24h interval
  - Captures key by value
  - Wraps work in `UIApplication.shared.beginBackgroundTask`
  - Runs backup via existing `performBackup(with:onProgress:onUploadProgress:)`
  - Updates `lastBackupTimestamp` on success
  - Sends local notification on failure (silent on success)
  - No UI interaction — fully fire-and-forget

### 2. `ContentView.swift` — Trigger after unlock
- In the existing `.onReceive(UIApplication.didBecomeActiveNotification)` or as a new `.onChange(of: appState.isUnlocked)`:
  - When `isUnlocked` becomes true and `currentVaultKey` is available
  - Call `iCloudBackupManager.shared.performBackupIfNeeded(with: key)`

### 3. `iCloudBackupSettingsView` — Remove "keep app open" warning
- Remove the "Keep the app open until backup completes" HStack
- The manual "Backup Now" button continues to work with progress UI

## Files
- `apps/ios/Vault/Core/Storage/iCloudBackupManager.swift` — new method
- `apps/ios/Vault/App/ContentView.swift` — trigger after unlock
- `apps/ios/Vault/Features/Settings/SettingsView.swift` — remove warning

## Reference
- `BackgroundShareTransferManager.swift` lines 109-127 — `beginBackgroundTask` pattern
- `BackgroundShareTransferManager.swift` line 148 — key capture pattern

## Verification
1. Build succeeds
2. Enable backup, lock vault, re-unlock → backup runs without visiting settings
3. Background app during backup → backup completes (check via Console.app logs)

There is a strange bug. On the join shared vault screen, if user taps into the text area, the background screen jumps up (see in the back).
