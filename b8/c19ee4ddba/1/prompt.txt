I want to expand the feature pages on the web (https://vaultaire.app/#features).

  I want to explain each feature deeply with detailed information on it's own page.

  I want to work on these:
  1. pattern encryption
  - how it works
  - how the math works and why nobody can break through
  - what's the enthropy of the encryption
  - why users should feel safe
  - what's the best pattern that is not going to be very predictable
  2. secret phrase
  - again, how it works
  - how can user use it
  - what a good phrase looks like
  - how to utilize them
  3. true plausible deniability
  - how it works
  - why it works
  - explain different alternative situation (e.g. border patrol, police search, etc)
  - why should user not worry
  4. hidden vaults
  - again how it works
  - why it works
  - how we implemented it such that nobody can find out
  - why is this important (describe various attack scenarios and how this protects from them)
  5. duress mode
  - what it is
  - how it works
  - why it's impossible to tell (describe exactly the step by step how user sets it up and why nobody can ever tell)
  - how they can use icloud backup to restore the vault after the event
  - that we reset the backup clock when the duress is triggered (give you 24 hours to restore data from icloud) [need to implement this, make a bead for it]
  6. encrypted icloud backup
  - why it works and how it works
  - how we implemented it that nobody can tell what's going on with it
  - how the background backup works
  7. secure sharing
  - how it works and what it is
  - how we implemented it and how can user use it
  - what options do they have with it (secret phrase, link, etc)
  - how we implemented updates to vaults
  - why is this working well and why is it superior to other forms of sharing
  - that they got options to limit the sharing like expiration date, number of opens, no export
  8. security features
  - no screenshots, no recording
  - no exports (if blocked)
  - encryption
  - anything else that makes sense for this section
  - talk about no security by obscurity
  9. features that make it easier to use
  - search
  - sorting
  - selecting all
  - anything else that fits here

  I want to update the features section with these 9 instead of 6. Then for each I want to make a subpage that explains these in detail with rich infographics
  and detailed explanations. I want you to use /humanizer skill for the copy and structure it well.

  I want you to use AskUserQuestion tool to ask me as many questions as needed to understand my desired goal and figure out the implementation and what
  information should each page contain. Then I want to work on the design of single subpage before we move on. I want you to plan this in steps instead of
  dumping everything at once.
