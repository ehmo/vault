Here is the full report:\n\n---\n\n## Paywall / Subscription Logic and Shared Vault Acceptance Flow\n\n### 1. Subscription Tier Models\n\n**File: `/Users/nan/Work/ai/vault/apps/ios/Vault/Core/Billing/SubscriptionManager.swift`**\n\nThere are no named \"tier\" enums. The model is binary: **free** vs **premium**. Premium is active if any StoreKit purchase is present or the testing override is set.\n\n```swift\nstatic let productIDs = [\n    \"monthly_pro\",\n    \"yearly_pro\",\n    \"lifetime\",\n]\n\nprivate(set) var isPremium = false\nnonisolated(unsafe) static var isPremiumSnapshot: Bool = false\n```\n\n**Free tier hard limits (all defined in `SubscriptionManager`):**\n```swift\nstatic let maxFreeVaults = 5\nstatic let maxFreeSharedVaults = 10\nstatic let maxFreeFilesPerVault = 100\n```\n\n**Premium feature enum (used for display, not gating logic directly):**\nFile: `/Users/nan/Work/ai/vault/apps/ios/Vault/Core/Billing/PaywallTrigger.swift`\n```swift\nenum PremiumFeature: String {\n    case unlimitedVaults\n    case unlimitedFiles\n    case sharedVault\n    case duressVault\n    case icloudSync\n    case expandedStorage\n}\n```\n\n**Protocol surface (for testability):**\nFile: `/Users/nan/Work/ai/vault/apps/ios/Vault/Core/Billing/SubscriptionClient.swift`\n```swift\nprotocol SubscriptionClient {\n    var isPremium: Bool { get }\n    func canCreateVault(currentCount: Int) -> Bool\n    func canJoinSharedVault(currentCount: Int) -> Bool\n    func canAddFile(currentFileCount: Int) -> Bool\n    func canCreateSharedVault() -> Bool\n    func canCreateDuressVault() -> Bool\n    func canSyncWithICloud() -> Bool\n    func canExpandStorage() -> Bool\n}\n```\n\n**Limit check implementations in `SubscriptionManager`:**\n```swift\nfunc canCreateVault(currentCount: Int) -> Bool {\n    isPremium || currentCount < Self.maxFreeVaults        // free: up to 5 vaults\n}\nfunc canJoinSharedVault(currentCount: Int) -> Bool {\n    isPremium || currentCount < Self.maxFreeSharedVaults  // free: up to 10 shared vaults\n}\nfunc canAddFile(currentFileCount: Int) -> Bool {\n    isPremium || currentFileCount < Self.maxFreeFilesPerVault  // free: up to 100 files\n}\nfunc canCreateSharedVault() -> Bool { isPremium }   // premium-only\nfunc canCreateDuressVault() -> Bool { isPremium }   // premium-only\nfunc canSyncWithICloud() -> Bool { isPremium }       // premium-only\nfunc canExpandStorage() -> Bool { isPremium }        // premium-only\n```\n\n---\n\n### 2. Paywall Presentation Mechanism\n\n**File: `/Users/nan/Work/ai/vault/apps/ios/Vault/Core/Billing/PaywallTrigger.swift`**\n\nA `ViewModifier` named `PremiumGateModifier` attaches via `.premiumPaywall(isPresented:)`. When a `showingPaywall` binding flips to `true`, it presents a `fullScreenCover`:\n- If StoreKit products are loaded: shows `VaultairePaywallView`\n- Otherwise: shows `FallbackPaywallView` (with sandbox override button for TestFlight)\n\n```swift\nstruct PremiumGateModifier: ViewModifier {\n    func body(content: Content) -> some View {\n        content\n            .fullScreenCover(isPresented: $showPaywall) {\n                if subscriptionManager.hasProducts {\n                    VaultairePaywallView(onDismiss: { showPaywall = false })\n                } else {\n                    FallbackPaywallView(showPaywall: $showPaywall)\n                }\n            }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n### 3. Gate: Creating a New Vault (PatternLockView)\n\n**File: `/Users/nan/Work/ai/vault/apps/ios/Vault/Features/PatternLock/PatternLockView.swift` (lines 247–267)**\n\nWhen a user draws a pattern that does not match any existing vault, the system checks the vault count:\n\n```swift\nif !subscriptionManager.isPremium, let key = derivedKey,\n   !VaultStorage.shared.vaultExists(for: VaultKey(key)) {\n    let vaultCount = VaultStorage.shared.existingVaultCount()\n    if !subscriptionManager.canCreateVault(currentCount: vaultCount) {\n        // Vault limit hit\n        if delay > 0 {\n            applyLockout(duration: delay)\n        } else {\n            showingPaywall = true   // <-- PAYWALL shown\n        }\n        return\n    }\n}\n```\n\nFree users can create up to 5 vaults. The 6th new vault triggers the paywall. Notably, if a brute-force counter has also accumulated delays, a lockout is applied instead of the paywall (both are gated here).\n\n---\n\n### 4. Gate: Adding Files to a Vault\n\n**Fan menu button (File: `/Users/nan/Work/ai/vault/apps/ios/Vault/Features/VaultViewer/VaultView+FanMenu.swift` lines 91–97)**\n```swift\nif subscriptionManager.canAddFile(currentFileCount: viewModel.files.count) {\n    // show add options menu\n} else {\n    showingPaywall = true   // <-- PAYWALL when at 100 files\n}\n```\n\n**Empty vault first-file prompt (File: `/Users/nan/Work/ai/vault/apps/ios/Vault/Features/VaultViewer/VaultView+Grid.swift` lines 181–185)**\n```swift\nif subscriptionManager.canAddFile(currentFileCount: viewModel.files.count) {\n    showingImportOptions = true\n} else {\n    showingPaywall = true\n}\n```\n\n**Photo picker import (File: `/Users/nan/Work/ai/vault/apps/ios/Vault/Features/VaultViewer/VaultViewModel.swift` lines 450–460)**\n```swift\nif !subscriptionManager.isPremium {\n    let remaining = max(0, SubscriptionManager.maxFreeFilesPerVault - self.files.count)\n    if remaining == 0 {\n        return (0, results.count)   // triggers paywall immediately\n    }\n    if results.count > remaining {\n        pendingImport = .photos(results)\n        return (remaining, results.count)   // triggers partial import alert\n    }\n}\n```\n\n**File importer import (VaultViewModel lines 576–585):** Same logic as photo picker.\n\nWhen the partial import alert is shown (`showingLimitAlert`), the user can choose \"Import N Files\" (partial) or \"Upgrade to PRO\" (which sets `showingPaywall = true`).\n\n---\n\n### 5. Gate: Sharing a Vault (outgoing)\n\n**File: `/Users/nan/Work/ai/vault/apps/ios/Vault/Features/Settings/VaultSettingsView.swift` (lines 97–114)**\n\nThe \"Share This Vault\" option in vault settings is only visible/active for premium users:\n\n```swift\nif subscriptionManager.canCreateSharedVault() {\n    Button(\"Share This Vault\") { showingShareVault = true }\n} else {\n    Button(action: { showingPaywall = true }) {\n        HStack {\n            Text(\"Share This Vault\")\n            Spacer()\n            Image(systemName: \"crown.fill\").foregroundStyle(.vaultHighlight)\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n`canCreateSharedVault()` returns `isPremium` — so sharing is **hard-blocked for free users**, crown icon shown as upsell.\n\nSimilarly, \"Use as duress vault\" (lines 143–144):\n```swift\n} else if !subscriptionManager.canCreateDuressVault() {\n    Button(action: { showingPaywall = true }) { ... }\n```\n\nAnd \"iCloud Backup\" in SettingsView (line 142):\n```swift\n} else {\n    Button(action: { showingPaywall = true }) { ... }\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n### 6. Gate: Joining / Accepting a Shared Vault (incoming)\n\nThere are **two entry points** for joining a shared vault:\n\n#### Entry Point A: Manual phrase entry — `JoinVaultView`\n\n**File: `/Users/nan/Work/ai/vault/apps/ios/Vault/Features/Sharing/JoinVaultView.swift`**\n\nThe \"Join Vault\" button (lines 160–166):\n```swift\nButton(action: {\n    if subscriptionManager.isPremium {\n        joinVault()       // proceed to phrase availability check + pattern setup\n    } else {\n        showingPaywall = true   // <-- PAYWALL for free users\n    }\n})\n```\n\nSo **free users cannot manually join a shared vault at all** — tapping \"Join Vault\" immediately shows the paywall regardless of how many shared vaults they already have. The `canJoinSharedVault(currentCount:)` method exists in the protocol but is **not used here** — the check is a direct `isPremium` gate.\n\n#### Entry Point B: Deep link / invite URL — `SharedVaultInviteView`\n\n**File: `/Users/nan/Work/ai/vault/apps/ios/Vault/Features/Sharing/SharedVaultInviteView.swift`**\n\nWhen tapping \"Accept Invite\" (lines 166–182):\n```swift\nButton {\n    Task {\n        let result = await CloudKitSharingManager.shared.checkPhraseAvailability(phrase: trimmed)\n        switch result {\n        case .success:\n            if subscriptionManager.isPremium {\n                mode = .patternSetup      // proceed to set vault pattern\n            } else {\n                showingPaywall = true     // <-- PAYWALL for free users\n            }\n        case .failure(let error):\n            mode = .error(error.localizedDescription)\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nSame logic: **free users hit the paywall before the pattern setup step**. The phrase availability is verified against CloudKit first (with Fibonacci retry logic: 1s, 2s, 3s, 5s, 8s, 13s delays), and if valid, the paywall is shown if not premium.\n\n#### After paywall dismissal / premium confirmed: Pattern Setup Flow\n\nOnce premium is confirmed (in both `JoinVaultView` and `SharedVaultInviteView`), the user draws a pattern on a 5x5 grid (minimum 6 nodes, 2+ direction changes), confirms it, and then `setupSharedVault()` runs:\n\n1. Derives `VaultKey` from the pattern via `KeyDerivation.deriveKey(from:gridSize:)`\n2. Checks if vault already exists for that key — prompts overwrite confirmation if so\n3. Sets `appState.currentVaultKey`, `currentPattern`, updates vault name\n4. Creates/saves an empty vault index\n5. Sets `appState.isUnlocked = true`, dismisses\n6. Calls `ShareImportManager.shared.startBackgroundDownloadAndImport(phrase:patternKey:)` — downloads and decrypts vault in background\n\n---\n\n### 7. Share Extension Free-Tier Limit\n\n**File: `/Users/nan/Work/ai/vault/apps/ios/Vault/Extensions/ShareExtension/ShareViewController.swift` (lines 155–163)**\n\nThe share extension reads premium status from the shared app group `UserDefaults` (since it runs in a separate process):\n\n```swift\nlet isPremium = UserDefaults(suiteName: VaultCoreConstants.appGroupIdentifier)?\n    .bool(forKey: VaultCoreConstants.isPremiumKey) ?? false\n\nif !isPremium,\n   counts.images > VaultCoreConstants.freeMaxImages ||   // > 100\n   counts.videos > VaultCoreConstants.freeMaxVideos ||   // > 10\n   counts.files > VaultCoreConstants.freeMaxFiles {       // > 100\n    throw StagedImportError.freeTierLimitExceeded\n}\n```\n\nThe `isPremiumKey` is synced to the app group `UserDefaults` whenever `refreshPremiumStatus()` runs in `SubscriptionManager`.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of All Paywall Trigger Points\n\n| Feature | Gate Method | Free Limit | Paywall Shown When |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| Create new vault (pattern unlock) | `canCreateVault(currentCount:)` | 5 vaults | Drawing a pattern for vault #6+ |\n| Add file (fan menu / empty state) | `canAddFile(currentFileCount:)` | 100 files | Vault already at 100 files |\n| Add files via photo picker | `isPremium` + count math | 100 files | Selecting files that would exceed 100 |\n| Add files via file importer | `isPremium` + count math | 100 files | Same |\n| Join shared vault (manual phrase) | `isPremium` (direct) | N/A | Any free user tapping \"Join Vault\" |\n| Accept shared vault invite (deep link) | `isPremium` (direct) | N/A | Any free user tapping \"Accept Invite\" |\n| Share vault outgoing | `canCreateSharedVault()` = `isPremium` | Premium-only | Tapping \"Share This Vault\" in settings |\n| Duress vault | `canCreateDuressVault()` = `isPremium` | Premium-only | Tapping \"Use as duress vault\" |\n| iCloud Backup | `canSyncWithICloud()` = `isPremium` | Premium-only | Tapping \"iCloud Backup\" in settings |\n| Share extension import | `isPremiumSnapshot` via AppGroup | 100 img/files, 10 vid | Sharing too many files via system share sheet |"},{"type":"text","text":"agentId: ab521150be8d1589b (for resuming to continue this agent's work if needed)\n<usage>total_tokens: 71349\ntool_uses: 23\nduration_ms: 90717</usage>"}]}]},"uuid":"6f443999-70d0-45e7-bd52-813a763ca977","timestamp":"2026-02-23T18:47:30.646Z","toolUseResult":{"status":"completed","prompt":"I need to understand the paywall/subscription logic and shared vault acceptance flow in this iOS app. \n\nFind and read:\n1.

Subscription Tier Models\n\n**File: `/Users/nan/Work/ai/vault/apps/ios/Vault/Core/Billing/SubscriptionManager.swift`**\n\nThere are no named \"tier\" enums. The model is binary: **free** vs **premium**. Premium is active if any StoreKit purchase is present or the testing override is set.\n\n```swift\nstatic let productIDs = [\n    \"monthly_pro\",\n    \"yearly_pro\",\n    \"lifetime\",\n]\n\nprivate(set) var isPremium = false\nnonisolated(unsafe) static var isPremiumSnapshot: Bool = false\n```\n\n**Free tier hard limits (all defined in `SubscriptionManager`):**\n```swift\nstatic let maxFreeVaults = 5\nstatic let maxFreeSharedVaults = 10\nstatic let maxFreeFilesPerVault = 100\n```\n\n**Premium feature enum (used for display, not gating logic directly):**\nFile: `/Users/nan/Work/ai/vault/apps/ios/Vault/Core/Billing/PaywallTrigger.swift`\n```swift\nenum PremiumFeature: String {\n    case unlimitedVaults\n    case unlimitedFiles\n    case sharedVault\n    case duressVault\n    case icloudSync\n    case expandedStorage\n}\n```\n\n**Protocol surface (for testability):**\nFile: `/Users/nan/Work/ai/vault/apps/ios/Vault/Core/Billing/SubscriptionClient.swift`\n```swift\nprotocol SubscriptionClient {\n    var isPremium: Bool { get }\n    func canCreateVault(currentCount: Int) -> Bool\n    func canJoinSharedVault(currentCount: Int) -> Bool\n    func canAddFile(currentFileCount: Int) -> Bool\n    func canCreateSharedVault() -> Bool\n    func canCreateDuressVault() -> Bool\n    func canSyncWithICloud() -> Bool\n    func canExpandStorage() -> Bool\n}\n```\n\n**Limit check implementations in `SubscriptionManager`:**\n```swift\nfunc canCreateVault(currentCount: Int) -> Bool {\n    isPremium || currentCount < Self.maxFreeVaults        // free: up to 5 vaults\n}\nfunc canJoinSharedVault(currentCount: Int) -> Bool {\n    isPremium || currentCount < Self.maxFreeSharedVaults  // free: up to 10 shared vaults\n}\nfunc canAddFile(currentFileCount: Int) -> Bool {\n    isPremium || currentFileCount < Self.maxFreeFilesPerVault  // free: up to 100 files\n}\nfunc canCreateSharedVault() -> Bool { isPremium }   // premium-only\nfunc canCreateDuressVault() -> Bool { isPremium }   // premium-only\nfunc canSyncWithICloud() -> Bool { isPremium }       // premium-only\nfunc canExpandStorage() -> Bool { isPremium }        // premium-only\n```\n\n---\n\n### 2. Paywall Presentation Mechanism\n\n**File: `/Users/nan/Work/ai/vault/apps/ios/Vault/Core/Billing/PaywallTrigger.swift`**\n\nA `ViewModifier` named `PremiumGateModifier` attaches via `.premiumPaywall(isPresented:)`. When a `showingPaywall` binding flips to `true`, it presents a `fullScreenCover`:\n- If StoreKit products are loaded: shows `VaultairePaywallView`\n- Otherwise: shows `FallbackPaywallView` (with sandbox override button for TestFlight)\n\n```swift\nstruct PremiumGateModifier: ViewModifier {\n    func body(content: Content) -> some View {\n        content\n            .fullScreenCover(isPresented: $showPaywall) {\n                if subscriptionManager.hasProducts {\n                    VaultairePaywallView(onDismiss: { showPaywall = false })\n                } else {\n                    FallbackPaywallView(showPaywall: $showPaywall)\n                }\n            }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n### 3. Gate: Creating a New Vault (PatternLockView)\n\n**File: `/Users/nan/Work/ai/vault/apps/ios/Vault/Features/PatternLock/PatternLockView.swift` (lines 247–267)**\n\nWhen a user draws a pattern that does not match any existing vault, the system checks the vault count:\n\n```swift\nif !subscriptionManager.isPremium, let key = derivedKey,\n   !VaultStorage.shared.vaultExists(for: VaultKey(key)) {\n    let vaultCount = VaultStorage.shared.existingVaultCount()\n    if !subscriptionManager.canCreateVault(currentCount: vaultCount) {\n        // Vault limit hit\n        if delay > 0 {\n            applyLockout(duration: delay)\n        } else {\n            showingPaywall = true   // <-- PAYWALL shown\n        }\n        return\n    }\n}\n```\n\nFree users can create up to 5 vaults. The 6th new vault triggers the paywall. Notably, if a brute-force counter has also accumulated delays, a lockout is applied instead of the paywall (both are gated here).\n\n---\n\n### 4. Gate: Adding Files to a Vault\n\n**Fan menu button (File: `/Users/nan/Work/ai/vault/apps/ios/Vault/Features/VaultViewer/VaultView+FanMenu.swift` lines 91–97)**\n```swift\nif subscriptionManager.canAddFile(currentFileCount: viewModel.files.count) {\n    // show add options menu\n} else {\n    showingPaywall = true   // <-- PAYWALL when at 100 files\n}\n```\n\n**Empty vault first-file prompt (File: `/Users/nan/Work/ai/vault/apps/ios/Vault/Features/VaultViewer/VaultView+Grid.swift` lines 181–185)**\n```swift\nif subscriptionManager.canAddFile(currentFileCount: viewModel.files.count) {\n    showingImportOptions = true\n} else {\n    showingPaywall = true\n}\n```\n\n**Photo picker import (File: `/Users/nan/Work/ai/vault/apps/ios/Vault/Features/VaultViewer/VaultViewModel.swift` lines 450–460)**\n```swift\nif !subscriptionManager.isPremium {\n    let remaining = max(0, SubscriptionManager.maxFreeFilesPerVault - self.files.count)\n    if remaining == 0 {\n        return (0, results.count)   // triggers paywall immediately\n    }\n    if results.count > remaining {\n        pendingImport = .photos(results)\n        return (remaining, results.count)   // triggers partial import alert\n    }\n}\n```\n\n**File importer import (VaultViewModel lines 576–585):** Same logic as photo picker.\n\nWhen the partial import alert is shown (`showingLimitAlert`), the user can choose \"Import N Files\" (partial) or \"Upgrade to PRO\" (which sets `showingPaywall = true`).\n\n---\n\n### 5. Gate: Sharing a Vault (outgoing)\n\n**File: `/Users/nan/Work/ai/vault/apps/ios/Vault/Features/Settings/VaultSettingsView.swift` (lines 97–114)**\n\nThe \"Share This Vault\" option in vault settings is only visible/active for premium users:\n\n```swift\nif subscriptionManager.canCreateSharedVault() {\n    Button(\"Share This Vault\") { showingShareVault = true }\n} else {\n    Button(action: { showingPaywall = true }) {\n        HStack {\n            Text(\"Share This Vault\")\n            Spacer()\n            Image(systemName: \"crown.fill\").foregroundStyle(.vaultHighlight)\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n`canCreateSharedVault()` returns `isPremium` — so sharing is **hard-blocked for free users**, crown icon shown as upsell.\n\nSimilarly, \"Use as duress vault\" (lines 143–144):\n```swift\n} else if !subscriptionManager.canCreateDuressVault() {\n    Button(action: { showingPaywall = true }) { ... }\n```\n\nAnd \"iCloud Backup\" in SettingsView (line 142):\n```swift\n} else {\n    Button(action: { showingPaywall = true }) { ... }\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n### 6.

Looking at the `VaultIndex`, it has a `sharedVaultId` field. So a shared vault is one where the index has a non-nil `sharedVaultId`. Let me see if there's already a method to count shared vaults, or if I need to create one.\n\nLet me check if there's a way to count shared vaults from `VaultStorage`. We'd need to iterate over all vault indexes and check which ones have `sharedVaultId` set. But that requires loading and decrypting each index, which seems expensive.\n\nActually, looking more carefully at the code, I think the `existingVaultCount()` method just counts vault index files. \n\nSo there's no straightforward way to count shared vaults without loading the indexes. But I notice the model has separate limits—`maxFreeVaults = 5` for regular vaults and `maxFreeSharedVaults = 10` for shared ones—so I can't just use the total vault count against a single limit.\n\nThe `canJoinSharedVault` method expects a shared vault count parameter, but there's no existing method to retrieve that. I could pass the total vault count from `existingVaultCount()`, and since `maxFreeSharedVaults = 10` is higher than `maxFreeVaults = 5`, it seems the design intends to be more permissive with shared vault joins. But looking at the intent more carefully, `maxFreeSharedVaults = 10` probably means the maximum number of shared vaults specifically, not total vaults.\n\nActually, I realize `existingVaultCount()` counts vault index files, which includes shared vaults since they're also vault index files. So the most practical solution is to just pass `existingVaultCount()` to `canJoinSharedVault()` as the current count parameter.\n\nSince `maxFreeSharedVaults = 10` and `maxFreeVaults = 5`, a free user with 5 personal vaults can still join up to 5 more shared vaults for a total of 10. This approach isn't perfectly granular—it doesn't distinguish between shared and non-shared vaults—but it's safe and generous enough for the use case.\n\nThe real intent seems to be that free users can create up to 5 vaults and join up to 10 shared vaults independently, but without separate tracking, I'll use the total vault count as a practical solution. Since the limit of 10 is generous, it works well: if someone has 5 personal vaults and wants to join shared ones, they can still add up to 5 more.\n\nI'll use `VaultStorage.shared.existingVaultCount()` as the parameter since that's what the vault creation check already uses. Now I need to update both `JoinVaultView.swift` at line 161 and `SharedVaultInviteView.swift` at line 174 to replace the `subscriptionManager.isPremium` check with `subscriptionManager.canJoinSharedVault(currentCount: VaultStorage.shared.existingVaultCount())`.\n\nMaking both edits

The unit tests for the subscription logic are solid. What I need to test is the integration behavior - that the views actually use `canJoinSharedVault` instead of `isPremium`. \n\nSince these are SwiftUI views, the best way to test the gating logic is to verify that the correct method is called. But the views directly use `SubscriptionManager` from the environment, not `SubscriptionClient`. This makes them hard to unit test directly.\n\nHowever, I can write a focused test that verifies the key semantic difference: a free user should be allowed to join a shared vault when under the limit. Let me think about what kind of test makes sense here.\n\n\nThe subscription-level tests already cover the logic, so the real issue was that the view layer wasn't calling the right method. I should check if there are any view-level tests I need to add to ensure the views are actually using `canJoinSharedVault` for join operations and `isPremium` for create operations.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":4270,"cache_read_input_tokens":57037,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":4270},"output_tokens":8,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"not_available"}},"requestId":"req_011CYRWDjcCfvxixhDvC8Fpv","type":"assistant","uuid":"0a0114d1-e2da-4abc-abe4-be32695ca835","timestamp":"2026-02-23T18:51:50.680Z"}
