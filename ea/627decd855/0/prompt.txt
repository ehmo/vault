There is a logical bug. While sharing a vault with someone is paid functionality, receiving a vault from someone isn't. Currently if user is on a free version they are unable to add shared vault as we show them the paywall. They should be add it as long as they don't go over the limits of their free tier.

Again, when you are done, write tests, send the build to the testing phone and then commit all to git
