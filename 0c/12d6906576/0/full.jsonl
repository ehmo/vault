If the user minimizes the app, the upload gets suspended/killed but the phrase is already shared — creating a race condition where user B tries to join but the upload isn't complete. Additionally, user A has no visibility into whether user B accepted the share.\n\n**Goal**: Restructure the share flow to (1) block user interaction during upload with a progress screen, (2) only reveal the phrase after upload completes, (3) persist phrase per share until recipient claims it, and (4) show claimed/policy status per share row.\n\n## Changes Overview\n\n### 1. Add `phrase` field to `ShareRecord`\n\n**File**: `apps/ios/Vault/Core/Storage/VaultIndexTypes.swift`\n\n- Add `var phrase: String?` to `ShareRecord`\n- Add `var isClaimed: Bool?` to `ShareRecord` (local cache of CloudKit claimed status)\n- The phrase is stored encrypted in the vault index (already encrypted at rest), only visible until claimed\n\n### 2. Add `claimedStatusByShareVaultIds` to CloudKit layer\n\n**File**: `apps/ios/Vault/Core/Sharing/CloudKitSharingManager.swift`\n\n- New method: `func claimedStatusByShareVaultIds(_ ids: [String]) async throws -> [String: Bool]`\n- Same pattern as `consumedStatusByShareVaultIds` but reads `claimed` field instead of `consumed`\n\n**File**: `apps/ios/Vault/Core/Sharing/CloudKitSharingClient.swift`\n\n- Add protocol requirement: `func claimedStatusByShareVaultIds(_ shareVaultIds: [String]) async throws -> [String: Bool]`\n\n### 3. Store phrase in `ShareRecord` when upload completes\n\n**File**: `apps/ios/Vault/Core/Sharing/ShareUploadManager.swift`\n\n- In `appendShareRecord()` (~line 1080): pass `phrase` parameter, store it in the new `ShareRecord.phrase` field\n- Thread phrase through from `runInitialUpload` and `runResumeUpload` to `appendShareRecord`\n\n### 4. Restructure `ShareVaultView` flow\n\n**File**: `apps/ios/Vault/Features/Sharing/ShareVaultView.swift`\n\nThis is the main UI change. The current `ViewMode` enum changes:\n\n```\nCurrent:  loading | iCloudUnavailable | newShare | manageShares | error\nNew:      loading | iCloudUnavailable | newShare | uploading | phraseReveal | manageShares | error\n```\n\n#### New `.uploading` state (full-screen progress)\n- Shows when user taps \"Share Vault\" button\n- Full-screen progress view with:\n  - Animated progress bar/percentage\n  - Current status message (from UploadJob.message)\n  - Warning text: \"Keep the app open. Minimizing will pause the upload.\"\n  - \"Terminate Upload\" button (destructive, with confirmation alert)\n- Close button shows confirmation alert: \"Upload in progress. Leaving will pause the upload. Are you sure?\" → Cancel / Leave\n- Monitors the specific UploadJob for this share\n- On job completion → transitions to `.phraseReveal`\n- On job failure → shows error with retry option\n- Keeps idle timer disabled (reuse existing `IdleTimerManager` pattern)\n\n#### New `.phraseReveal` state\n- Shows phrase only AFTER upload is complete\n- Reuses existing `PhraseDisplayCard` and `PhraseActionButtons` components\n- Reuses existing `shareLinkButtons` for Copy Link / Share\n- \"Done\" button → transitions to `.manageShares`\n\n#### Updated `.manageShares` state\nEach share row (`shareRow`) changes:\n- **Badge**: \"Pending\" (orange) if not claimed, \"Accepted\" (green) if claimed, \"Syncing\" (blue) if syncing\n- **Phrase**: Show phrase + copy/share buttons if `isClaimed != true` (pending). Hide phrase when claimed.\n- **Policy summary**: Show policy restrictions inline (e.g., \"No exports\", \"10 opens max\", \"Expires Mar 15\")\n- **Revoke**: Keep existing revoke button\n\n#### Updated `reconcileConsumedShares` → rename to `reconcileShareStatuses`\n- Query both consumed AND claimed status from CloudKit\n- Update local `ShareRecord.isClaimed` when claimed detected\n- Remove consumed shares (existing behavior)\n- When claimed: set `isClaimed = true`, clear `phrase` from ShareRecord, persist to index\n\n### 5. Prevent close during upload (full app modal behavior)\n\nThe `ShareVaultView` is already presented as `.fullScreenCover` from `VaultSettingsView`. During the `.uploading` state:\n- Hide the \"Close\" toolbar button (or replace with terminate confirmation)\n- Set `.interactiveDismissDisabled(true)` to prevent swipe dismiss\n- The `.uploading` state acts as the blocking mechanism\n\n### Files Modified\n\n| File | Change |\n|------|--------|\n| `apps/ios/Vault/Core/Storage/VaultIndexTypes.swift` | Add `phrase`, `isClaimed` to ShareRecord |\n| `apps/ios/Vault/Core/Sharing/CloudKitSharingManager.swift` | Add `claimedStatusByShareVaultIds` |\n| `apps/ios/Vault/Core/Sharing/CloudKitSharingClient.swift` | Add protocol method |\n| `apps/ios/Vault/Core/Sharing/ShareUploadManager.swift` | Thread phrase to `appendShareRecord` |\n| `apps/ios/Vault/Features/Sharing/ShareVaultView.swift` | Main UI restructure (uploading + phraseReveal modes, updated shareRow, claimed status) |\n\n### Guardrails Compliance\n\n- No pattern board changes (not relevant to this view)\n- Fixed heights for dynamic content (progress area, phrase area)\n- `.lineLimit(nil)` on all descriptive text\n- No layout shifts: uploading/phraseReveal are distinct states, not conditional overlays\n\n### Existing Code Reused\n\n- `PhraseDisplayCard` / `PhraseActionButtons` (`Vault/UI/Components/PhraseActionButtons.swift`)\n- `ShareLinkEncoder.shareURL(for:)` for link generation\n- `ShareSheetHelper.present(items:)` for native share sheet\n- `IdleTimerManager.shared` for keeping screen awake during upload\n- `PixelLoader` for loading animations\n- `uploadStatusBadge` pattern for status capsule badges\n- `.vaultGlassBackground()`, `.vaultProminentButtonStyle()` modifiers\n- `consumedStatusByShareVaultIds` pattern for the new claimed query\n- `ShareUploadManager.UploadJob` for progress monitoring\n\n### Verification\n\n1. **Unit tests**: Update `ShareVaultViewModeTests` for new ViewMode cases\n2. **Upload flow**: Start share → verify progress screen blocks interaction → verify phrase shown only after completion\n3. **Pause/resume**: Start share → terminate from progress screen → verify cleanup\n4. **Close during upload**: Tap close → verify confirmation alert → verify pause behavior\n5. **Claimed status**: After user B joins, verify user A's share row updates from \"Pending\" to \"Accepted\" and phrase disappears\n6. **Multiple shares**: Create 2 shares → verify each shows its own phrase independently\n7. **Policy display**: Create share with limits → verify limits shown in manage view\n8. **Build**: `xcodebuild build` to verify compilation\n9. **Existing tests**: Run test suite to verify no regressions\n\n\nIf you need specific details from before exiting plan mode (like exact code snippets, error messages, or content you generated), read the full transcript at: /Users/nan/.REDACTED.jsonl"},"uuid":"92ed6044-b717-4dc1-a99b-e68c5ccaf2b1","timestamp":"2026-02-26T19:44:43.184Z","planContent":"# Redesign Share Vault Flow\n\n## Context\n\nWhen user A shares a vault, the current flow immediately shows the phrase while uploading in the background.

Here's a summary of everything implemented:\n\n## Changes Summary\n\n### Data Model (`VaultIndexTypes.swift`)\n- Added `phrase: String?` and `isClaimed: Bool?` to `ShareRecord`\n\n### CloudKit Layer\n- **`CloudKitSharingClient.swift`**: Added `claimedStatusByShareVaultIds` protocol requirement\n- **`CloudKitSharingManager.swift`**: Implemented `claimedStatusByShareVaultIds` (mirrors `consumedStatusByShareVaultIds` but reads `claimed` field)\n\n### Upload Manager (`ShareUploadManager.swift`)\n- Added `phrase` parameter to `appendShareRecord()` and threaded it through all 3 call sites (initial upload, resume-when-finished, resume-upload-then-finalize)\n\n### UI (`ShareVaultView.swift`) — Main restructure\n- **New ViewMode cases**: `.uploading(jobId:)` and `.phraseReveal(phrase:shareVaultId:)`\n- **`.uploading` screen**: Full-screen progress with percentage, status message, \"Keep app open\" warning, terminate button with confirmation alert, `.interactiveDismissDisabled`, close button shows \"upload in progress\" alert\n- **`.phraseReveal` screen**: Shows phrase + copy/share buttons only after upload completes, with \"Done\" button to transition to manage\n- **Updated share rows**: Pending/Accepted/Syncing badges based on `isClaimed`, inline policy summary chips (e.g. \"No exports\", \"10 opens max\", \"Expires Mar 15\"), phrase+share buttons visible only when unclaimed\n- **`reconcileShareStatuses`**: Renamed from `reconcileConsumedShares`, now queries both consumed AND claimed in parallel, clears phrase and sets `isClaimed=true` when claimed\n\n### Tests\n- Added `claimedStatusByShareVaultIds` stubs to all 4 mock implementations\n- Added 3 new tests: `testResolveModePreservesUploadingState`, `testResolveModePreservesPhraseRevealState`, policy description tests\n- All 19 `ShareVaultViewModeTests` pass, full test suite passes (pre-existing PatternBoard failures only)"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":245,"cache_read_input_tokens":108184,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":245},"output_tokens":2,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"not_available"}},"requestId":"req_011CYXGjAb54nnhQPWNkxthd","type":"assistant","uuid":"bb6f9b46-6082-40c4-8d46-940cb755f883","timestamp":"2026-02-26T19:58:28.825Z"}

VaultIndexTypes.swift — `phrase` and `isClaimed` fields\n- **Backward compatibility**: Both fields are `var` and optional (`String?` / `Bool?`). Since `ShareRecord` is `Codable`, the new fields will decode as `nil` for existing data. ✅ Safe.\n- **CodingKeys**: ShareRecord uses automatic `Codable` synthesis, so new properties are automatically included. ✅\n- **Sendable**: `String?` and `Bool?` are both `Sendable`. \n\n### 2. CloudKitSharingClient.swift — protocol method\n- Added `claimedStatusByShareVaultIds`. All conformers now implement it. ✅\n- No default implementation needed since all conformers provide one. ✅\n\n### 3. CloudKitSharingManager.swift — `claimedStatusByShareVaultIds`\n- Mirrors the pattern from `consumedStatusByShareVaultIds` but checks the `claimed` field instead. ✅\n- Early return on empty guard. ✅\n- Uses `reserveCapacity` for efficiency. ✅\n- Checking if there's a potential issue with both methods...\n\nBoth methods query the same manifest records from CloudKit but extract different fields, so `reconcileShareStatuses` ends up making two queries that fetch identical data. It's not a bug—just follows the existing approach—but could be consolidated later if needed.\n\n### 4. ShareUploadManager.swift — `appendShareRecord` with phrase\n- Added optional `phrase` parameter and updated all three call sites. ✅\n- First call site pulls `phrase` from the function parameter. ✅\n- Second call site in `runResumeUpload` uses the stored `state.phrase` when `uploadFinished` is true. ✅\n- Third call site also uses `state.phrase` for new upload completion. ✅\n- The assignment happens after record construction since `phrase` is mutable. ✅\n\n### 5. ShareVaultView.swift — Main UI changes\n\n#### ViewMode enum changes\n- Added `.uploading(jobId:)` and `.phraseReveal(phrase:shareVaultId:)` cases. ✅\n- `resolveMode` correctly preserves both new states without auto-transitioning. ✅\n\n#### `refreshUploadJobs` — upload completion detection\n- Found an issue: when an upload finishes, `shouldDisplayUploadJob` filters out `.complete` status jobs, so the UI never sees the completion event to trigger the phrase reveal transition.\n- But actually, the code uses `latestJobs` (the unfiltered list) to find the matching job, not the filtered `uploadJobs`, so the completion detection works correctly. ✅\n\nHowever, there's a critical timing issue: the `ShareUploadManager` removes the job immediately after the upload completes via `removeJob(jobId:)`, but the polling loop that checks for completion runs a second later. By the time `refreshUploadJobs` executes and queries `latestJobs`, the job is already gone from the manager, so we'll never detect that the upload finished and the UI will stay stuck in the `.uploading` state indefinitely.\n\nWait, let me reconsider — when `removeJob` is called and the job disappears, the `runningUploadCount` drops to zero, which triggers `reloadActiveShares()`. Since `appendShareRecord` was already called before the job was removed, the share record should already exist in the index by that point.\n\nSo when we reload, `activeShares` gets populated. But here's the issue: we're still in `.uploading` mode, and when we check for the matching job by ID, it's gone. We don't hit any of the conditional branches, so we fall through to `updateModeForCurrentData()`. Since `resolveMode` just preserves the current mode when we have active shares, we end up stuck in `.uploading` with nothing to display.\n\nThe solution is to detect when the job has been removed — meaning it completed — and transition directly to `.phraseReveal` by looking for the phrase in the newly-loaded share record.\n\nNow looking at `startUploadAndShowProgress`, it uses a 100ms delay before finding the job by phrase match, which feels fragile. But since `startBackgroundUpload` calls `upsertJob` synchronously on the main actor and `startUploadAndShowProgress` is also main-threaded, the job should be available right away. The delay just yields control briefly, so it's unnecessary but harmless. The real risk is matching the wrong job if two shares happen to use the same phrase, though that's unlikely given how phrases are generated.\n\nFor `reconcileShareStatuses`, I'm setting up parallel queries...\n\nBoth CloudKit calls run concurrently with `async let`, and if either fails, both get cancelled properly. The sequential awaits look like they'd block, but since both tasks are already running in the background, one failing just means we lose that data — which is fine since we retry on the next initialization.\n\nNow checking the overlap scenarios: consumed shares take priority over claimed ones since consumed means self-destructed, which is correct. The dismiss behavior is tied to the uploading state, and the terminate alert correctly looks up the job from the current mode. The `linkCopied` state is shared across both the phrase reveal and share rows, so if a user triggers it from either place, both views will reflect the copied state.\n\nI've identified the main bug: when `ShareUploadManager` completes a job and calls `removeJob`, the polling in `refreshUploadJobs` may find no matching job while still in `.uploading` mode, leaving the view stuck indefinitely. The fix is to detect when a job disappears in uploading mode and check if a share with a phrase now exists—if so, transition out of uploading. There's also the question of what happens when `removeJob` is called after upload completion.\n\nNow I'm realizing the core issue: we store only the `jobId` in `.uploading` mode, not the `shareVaultId`, so if the job vanishes we can't look up which share was created. The simplest solution is to just transition to `.manageShares` when the job disappears—the new share will already be visible there with its phrase. When the job vanishes from the uploading state, the shares should have already reloaded since the upload count hit zero, so I can just check `activeShares` for the most recently created share with a phrase. The simplest approach though: just transition to `.manageShares` when the job disappears—the share will display there with its phrase. Or I could pass the phrase directly into the uploading state itself to avoid the lookup entirely.\n\nModifying the uploading case...\n\nNow I'm checking for potential issues with the implementation—making sure the new optional fields on ShareRecord won't break existing data, that all UI mutations happen on the main thread, and that there aren't any memory leaks or retain cycles.\n\nActually, I'm realizing there might be a race condition in `startUploadAndShowProgress`. The `startBackgroundUpload` call is synchronous on the main actor and creates the job immediately, so the 100ms wait before looking it up should be fine. But between that call returning and the Task block executing, the 1-second polling loop could fire and change the mode away from loading.\n\nWait, but we haven't actually set the mode to `.uploading` yet at that point—that happens inside the Task. So there's a brief window where a new upload job exists but the mode is still `.newShare`. When the polling loop runs and calls `resolveMode`, it sees `.newShare` and preserves that manual state, so the mode stays `.newShare` until the Task finally sets it to `.uploading`. That's actually fine since the manual state takes precedence.\n\nThough there's an edge case: if the upload completes incredibly fast (under 100ms), the job might already be done or removed by the time we check for it. If it's removed, we'd fall through to `refreshUploadJobs` and switch to `.manageShares`. But in practice, real uploads take long enough that this shouldn't be an issue.\n\nThe fix I'm proposing—carrying phrase and shareVaultId in the mode itself—helps with completion detection rather than the startup race. For startup, the 100ms delay plus phrase matching is sufficient.\n\nLet me verify the idle timer and dismiss behavior are handled correctly. The idle timer stays disabled as long as there's a running job in uploadJobs, and the interactive dismiss is controlled by the `isUploading` computed property from mode. Both check out. Now looking at what happens when the terminate confirmation alert fires and extracts the jobId from the mode...\n\nUpdating the pattern match...\n\nI'm also noticing a potential issue with the `shouldDisplayUploadJob` filter when `refreshUploadJobs` runs. It fetches the latest jobs and filters them, then checks if we need to reload shares based on whether running uploads just completed. The `runningUploadCount` is derived from...\n\nNow I'm seeing the flow: if a job was removed from the manager, it won't be in `latestJobs`, so `uploadJobs` becomes empty. Since `previousRunningCount` was greater than zero when the job was active, `shouldReloadShares` triggers true, which calls `reloadActiveShares()` to fetch the updated share record. That part works correctly.\n\nBut then when checking if an uploading job completed, the code tries to find a matching job by ID in `latestJobs`, which returns nil since the job was removed. This falls through to `updateModeForCurrentData()`, and `resolveMode(.uploading, hasShareData: true)` just preserves the uploading state...\n\nso we're stuck in uploading mode even though the job is gone. The fix is to store the phrase and shareVaultId directly in the mode itself, so when the job disappears, we can transition to phraseReveal with that data intact.\n\nOne more thing to verify: `reloadActiveShares()` is async, but `refreshUploadJobs` awaits it before continuing, so by the time we check for the matching job, the shares are already loaded. That timing works out.\n\nLet me start implementing this fix

The 1-second polling loop in `refreshUploadJobs` then can't find the job (`matchingJob == nil`), and `resolveMode` preserves `.uploading` mode — **the user gets stuck on the uploading screen forever with no job data shown**.\n\n**Root cause**: The `.uploading(jobId:)` mode only carries the jobId. When the job disappears from the manager, we can't look up the phrase or shareVaultId to transition to `.phraseReveal`.\n\n**Fix**: Carry `phrase` and `shareVaultId` in the `.uploading` case.

Here's the full review summary:\n\n## Review Results\n\n### Bug Found & Fixed\n\n**Upload completion race condition** in `refreshUploadJobs`: When `ShareUploadManager` completes a job, it calls `removeJob(jobId:)` immediately. The 1-second polling loop would then find `matchingJob == nil`, but `resolveMode` preserved `.uploading` — **trapping the user on the upload screen forever** with no job data.\n\n**Fix**: Changed `.uploading(jobId:)` → `.uploading(jobId:, phrase:, shareVaultId:)` so the phrase and shareVaultId are available even after the job disappears. When `matchingJob == nil` (job removed after completion), transitions directly to `.phraseReveal`.\n\n### Other Verified (No Issues)\n\n- **Codable backward compat**: New `phrase`/`isClaimed` fields are optional — old indexes decode fine (verified with test)\n- **Thread safety**: All UI mutations on MainActor, `reconcileShareStatuses` uses `Task.detached` + `MainActor.run` correctly\n- **All 3 `appendShareRecord` call sites**: Correctly pass `phrase` from available context (`runInitialUpload` has `phrase` param, resume paths use `state.phrase`)\n- **`claimedStatusByShareVaultIds`**: Correctly reads `claimed` field (not `consumed`), follows same pattern\n- **All 4 mock conformances**: Updated with new protocol method\n- **No dangling references**: `reconcileConsumedShares` fully removed, no callers left\n\n### Comprehensive Test Coverage (45 tests)\n\n| Category | Tests | What's verified |\n|----------|-------|-----------------|\n| resolveMode state machine | 16 | Every mode × hasShareData combination. Uploading + phraseReveal preserved regardless |\n| ShareRecord Codable | 3 | Backward compat (no new fields), round-trip with phrase+isClaimed, claimed=true+nil phrase |\n| Policy description | 7 | Each restriction type, all combined, defaults, edge cases |\n| shouldDisplayUploadJob | 3 | All 7 statuses correctly filtered |\n| Idle timer policy | 7 | Visible × status matrix, mixed jobs, empty list |\n| UploadJob helpers | 3 | isRunning/canResume/canTerminate for all statuses |\n| SharePolicy | 2 | Default values, equatable |\n| Duress interaction | 3 | Shared vault, active shares, active uploads |\n| Pending upload safety | 1 | Directory not deleted without state file |"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":245,"cache_read_input_tokens":158130,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":245},"output_tokens":2,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"not_available"}},"requestId":"req_011CYXHqYTVqu3z1APR5UZXv","type":"assistant","uuid":"e62fcaaa-25cd-46eb-8e04-ee13e07abeac","timestamp":"2026-02-26T20:13:06.084Z"}
