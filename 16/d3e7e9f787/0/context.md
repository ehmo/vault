### Prompt 1

Implement the following plan:

# Custom Paywall: Version A (Compare, Then Choose)

## Context
Current paywall uses RevenueCatUI's default `PaywallView()` with a single $9.99 lifetime product. Need to redesign with 3 tiers (Monthly $1.99, Yearly $9.99, Lifetime $29.99), a benefits comparison table, and 7-day free trial on yearly — all in Vaultaire's design language.

## Part 1: RevenueCat Product Setup (via MCP)

### Prompt 2

The first onboarding screen is scrollable for whatever reason (see image). It should be static

### Prompt 4

Push to testflight

### Prompt 5

The background screen also jumps when I use recovery phrase and tap into the text area. Make sure that this is fixed across the board

### Prompt 6

When setting up custom phrase in the vault, the design changes from the empty state (image 10) to text area being in focus (image 11) pushing everything up. The keyboard also hides the button (image 12) which is unreachable. We need to fix this. We should also add button at the right corner to the opposite side of cancel so user can just accept it there.

### Prompt 8

The "regenerate recovery phrase" screen in a vault looks very different (image 13) from the design we are using in the onboarding (image 14) and elsewhere. It's important that the design is equal across the board

### Prompt 10

The paywall screen is too long resulting in scrolling. We should remove the x button in the corner and also the vault icon to push everything up.

Change the title to Unlock Vaultaire Pro and push everything up. Above of the subscribe button, add button that enables free 7 day trial. When enabled change the subscribe button "Try for 7 days".

Move the save 58% and best value above the price on the right side.

I assume the skip is for testing

### Prompt 12

Push to testflight. Then figure out how to make this paywall in revenuecat instead of manually building it
